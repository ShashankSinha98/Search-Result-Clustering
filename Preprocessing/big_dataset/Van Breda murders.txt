The Van Breda murders were the killings of three family members and serious injury of another on 27 January 2015 at a golf estate in Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa. After a year and a half of investigations by the South African Police Service, the family's youngest son, Henri Christo van Breda, surrendered to police in June 2016 and was released on bail the next day.
Henri was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and obstruction of justice on 21 May 2018 by the Western Cape High Court.
He was sentenced to life imprisonment for each of the three murders; 15 years' for attempted murder; and 12 months' for obstruction. The sentences are to run concurrently.
