In 1925, after an amendment was made to the Georgian constitution, the Crisp County Power Commission (CCPC) was established.  The amendment was the result of a petition made by a group of residents from Crisp County to develop a hydroelectric power system along the Flint River.  Georgia government officials decided to build a power-dam in order to satisfy the Crisp County resident's request.  The Crisp County Hydroelectric Power Dam, proposed by CCPC, was the first power-dam in the United States to be owned, built and operated by a county.
