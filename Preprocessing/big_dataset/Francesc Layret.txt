Francesc Layret i Foix (10 July 1880 in Barcelona â€“ 30 November 1920 in Barcelona, Spain) was a Spanish politician and lawyer, Catalan nationalist and republican. He was assassinated in 1920 following the mass detention of several of his colleagues and other left-wing politicians and union leaders.
Layret was a democrat, republican, Catalan nationalist and defender of social justice. His commitment to the reality of his time and of Catalonia led him to collaborate with the working-class movement and the libertarian movement, helping to make Barcelona internationally known as the "rose of fire" for his role of avant-guard in the fight against oppression and exploitation.
