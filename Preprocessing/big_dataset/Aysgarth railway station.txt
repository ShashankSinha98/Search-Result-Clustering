Aysgarth railway station is a disused railway station in North Yorkshire, England, near Aysgarth Falls. It was part of the Hawes Branch of the North Eastern Railway from its opening in 1877 until closure in April 1954.
The Wensleydale Railway Association aims to rebuild the railway from Northallerton (from its current western terminus at Redmire) to Garsdale and plans to re-open the station.
