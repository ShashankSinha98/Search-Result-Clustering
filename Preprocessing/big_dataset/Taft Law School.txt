Taft Law School is an unaccredited, for-profit, private, and online law school in Santa Ana, California. It was founded in 1976 and operates through the Taft University System (William Howard Taft University). The school offers Juris Doctor (J.D.) and Master of Laws (LL.M.) law degree programs.
The school is not accredited by the American Bar Association nor by the State Bar of California.  The Law School Admission Council lists Taft Law School as  a "Non-ABA-Approved Law School" and explains that most states do not "permit graduates of these schools to take the bar examination" nor "admit to their bars a graduate of a non-ABA-approved law school."
The California State Bar Committee of Bar Examiners categorizes Taft Law School as a "registered unaccredited correspondence law school." As such, its graduates must pass the First-Year Law Students' Examination (Baby Bar) in order to be eligible to take the California General Bar Examination.
