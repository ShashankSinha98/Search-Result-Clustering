Suppressor of fused homolog is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SUFU gene.
In molecular biology, the protein domain suppressor of fused protein (Sufu) has an important role in the cell. The Sufu is important in negatively regulating an important signalling pathway in the cell, the Hedgehog signalling pathway (HH). This particular pathway is crucial in embryonic development. There are several homologues of Sufu, found in a wide variety of organisms.
