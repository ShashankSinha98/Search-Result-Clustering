About the tour, Bentley said, "This tour is the culmination of everything I've been working on for the past two years, both out on the road and in the studio recording 'Riser'". "I know my fans want a kick ass show, an affordable ticket and a  good parking lot scene to set the pregame going". "when it comes time for my set, I can promise that we are going big! I have never been more excited about a tour".The second leg of the tour was announced on August 11, 2014, and began in October 2014, in Stockton, California. Randy Houser, Eric Paslay and Tim Hicks were the opening acts. Bentley said, "It's going to be tough to top this summer, but every night I get more excited and don't want this run to end. I'm just living in the moment as much as I can and taking it all in...it really has been the best summer of my life."
