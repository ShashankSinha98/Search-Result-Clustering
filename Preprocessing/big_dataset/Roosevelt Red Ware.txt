Roosevelt Red Ware, also known as Salado Red Ware and Salado Polychrome, is a late prehistoric pottery tradition found across large portions of Arizona and New Mexico. The tradition involves the combination of red, white, and black paint in varying configurations along with compositional and morphological characteristics.  This ceramic tradition begins about AD 1280-1290 and lasts until at least AD 1450 based on tree-ring dating.
