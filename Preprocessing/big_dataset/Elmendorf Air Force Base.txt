Elmendorf Air Force Base (IATA: EDF, ICAO: PAED, FAA LID: EDF) was a United States Air Force facility in Anchorage, Alaska. Originally known as Elmendorf Field, it became Elmendorf Air Force Base after World War II.
It was the home of the Headquarters, Alaskan Air Command (ALCOM), Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR), Eleventh Air Force (11 AF), the 673d Air Base Wing, the 3rd Wing, the 176th Wing and other tenant units.
In 2010 it was amalgamated with nearby Fort Richardson to form Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The adjacent facilities were officially combined by the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission. Its mission was to support and defend U.S. interests in the Asia Pacific region and around the world by providing units who are ready for worldwide air power projection and a base that is capable of meeting United States Pacific Command's theater staging and throughput requirements.
