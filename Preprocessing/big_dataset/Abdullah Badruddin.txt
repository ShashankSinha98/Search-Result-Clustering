Syedna Abdullah Badruddin bin Syedna AbdulHusain Husamuddin (Arabic: عبدُالله بَدرُالدين); born 11 July 1846) was an Indian-born religious leader, and the 50th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. He was the son of Syedna AbdulHusain Husamuddin, whose family lineage can be traced back to Syedi Fakhruddin Shaheed. When the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin did nass upon him, all those people who used to say, "After Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, the sect would come to an end", could not believe their eyes.By virtue of being the son of Syedna AbdulHusain Husamuddin he became very closely associated with his uncle the 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq, Syedna AbdulQadir Najmuddin. He was educated by his father in all fields of knowledge and he always remained at the service of his uncle, for the active part of his childhood and youth until age 39, helping him and also learning from him. Then he served his father for six years when he [his father] became the 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq. Later he also served the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin for fifteen years with great dedication and responsibility.
He was awarded with the greatest honor of becoming the 50th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. In 1915 he conferred nass upon Syedna Taher Saifuddin and died later in the year.
