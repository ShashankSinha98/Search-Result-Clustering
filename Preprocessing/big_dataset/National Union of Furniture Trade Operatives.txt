The National Union of Furniture Trade Operatives (NUFTO) was a trade union in the United Kingdom representing furniture makers.
The union was founded in 1947 by the merger of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association and the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers.  By the 1960s, the union was keen to merge with other in its sector; in 1969, it absorbed the United French Polishers' Society, and the following year, the Midland Glass Bevellers' and Kindred Trades' Society joined.By 1971, the union had 60,754 members and, that year, it merged with the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists to form the Furniture, Timber and Allied Trades Union.
