The Orient Square (officially The Orient Square Building or Orient Square IT Center, acronym: OSB or use as a code: OS) is a first-class, high-rise and tallest building along Ortigas Center's main road, F. Ortigas Jr. Avenue (known as Emerald Avenue) in Pasig, Philippines. It rises 160 metres from ground level to roof, and is currently the 7th tallest complete building in Pasig, and the 76th tallest building in the Philippines. The building has 38 levels above ground, and 7 basement levels. It will be a mixed-use building, both office and residential. Orient Square Building is currently one of the modern landmarks in Ortigas Center because of its architectural design and its one-of-a-kind curtain wall that glitters at night from the lights inside the building because of its transparency. The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) declared it an Information Technology Building in January 2006.
The building has a 6-level concrete podium as its base, while its main body is fully clad with aluminium unitized curtain wall. It has a distinctive design of having multiple corners, especially on the top floors, making it easily recognizable among the buildings in Ortigas Center.
