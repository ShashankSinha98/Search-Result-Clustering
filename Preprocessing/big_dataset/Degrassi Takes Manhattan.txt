Degrassi Takes Manhattan is the second feature-length movie of the Next Generation cast, and the third feature-length film in the Degrassi franchise, the first being 1992's School's Out. For syndication purposes, the film will also be shown as a four-part episode titled "The Rest of My Life".

An extended version of the film was released as a bonus on the show's season 9 DVD on 20 July 2010. The special acted as somewhat of a de facto series finale for The Next Generation.
