Web mining is the application of data mining techniques to discover patterns from the World Wide Web. It uses automated methods to extract both structured and unstructured data from web pages, server logs and link structures. There are three main sub-categories of web mining. Web content mining extracts information from within a page. Web structure mining discovers the structure of the hyperlinks between documents, categorizing sets of web pages and measuring the similarity and relationship between different sites. Web usage mining finds patterns of usage of web pages.
