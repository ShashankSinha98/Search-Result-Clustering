Salig Ram, popularly known by the honorific "Huzur Maharaj" and by the government-conferred title "Rai Bahadur," was born in Peepal Mandi, Agra, on 14 March 1829. He served as chief inspector of post offices in British India, and, in 1881, was Postmaster-General of the North-Western Provinces, based in Allahabad. He was the first Indian to hold the position.
Salig Ram came in contact with his guru, Shiv Dayal Singh, in 1858 in Agra. Salig Ram recognised his guru as the first physical incarnation of the Supreme Being, whom Salig Ram called by the name "Radha Soami." Salig Ram served Shiv Dayal Singh for many years and, after  Shiv Dayal Singh's death, Salig Ram retired from his job, and the Radha Soami sect in Agra took up the role of guru. He died on 6 December 1898.
