In molecular biology, the single-domain protein SUI1 is a translation initiation factor often found in the fungus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) but it is also found in other eukaryotes and prokaryotes as well as archaea. It is otherwise known as Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1) in eukaryotes or YciH in bacteria.
