The Oriental Club in London is an exclusive  gentlemen's club established in 1824 that also admits ladies since 1952, although ladies could not be full members until 2010. Charles Graves describes it as fine in quality as White's but with the space of 
infinitely larger clubs. It is located in Stratford Place, near Oxford Street and Bond Street.
