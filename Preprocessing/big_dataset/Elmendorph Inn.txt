The Elmendorph Inn, is the oldest building in the village of Red Hook, New York, United States. It is located at the north corner of North Broadway (US 9) and Cherry Street, a block north of the junction of Route 9 and NY 199.
It was built in the mid-18th century as an inn to serve long-distance travelers on the Albany Post Road. In the 1810s, it became the meeting place of the Red Hook Town Board for the next several decades. It has had a number of owners; the Elmendorphs are the earliest known ones. In the 1830s, it was expanded and renovated, eventually becoming just a residence. After a recent restoration it has become a community center. In 1978 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
