Trollkins is a 1981 animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that aired for one season on CBS. Essentially a cross between The Smurfs (which incidentally premiered the same day, September 12, 1981, in the same time slot at 8:30 ET) and The Dukes of Hazzard, it followed the misadventures of trolls Blitz, Pixlee, and Flooky.
