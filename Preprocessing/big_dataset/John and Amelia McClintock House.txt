The John and Amelia McClintock House is a historic building located at 321 E. Main Street in Grafton, Illinois. Boat builder John McClintock built the house for his family circa 1910. The rock-faced concrete house, an unusual departure from Grafton's limestone buildings, has a Queen Anne design. The entrance is located at the corner of a wraparound front porch and is topped by a conical roof. The front of the house has a cutaway bay, giving the house an asymmetrical appearance, and the gable roof has multiple components; both features are typical of Queen Anne designs. The building is now used as a commercial property.The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1994.
