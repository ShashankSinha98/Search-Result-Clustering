It was demolished, as described below, in 1955.The estate grounds now consist of largely arable farming with the recently (habitable from 2017) refurbished stable block accompanying, Home Farm, the North and South Lodges forming the only tangible links to the grandeur of one of the county\u0027s most well known and prominent families.\r\nGeorge Devey\r\nThe Shropshire Archives holds an interesting insight into the rebuilding of the \u0027new\u0027 hall by Henry Reginald Corbet, who invited renowned architect, George Devey, \u0027to inspect the old house of Adderley to make it habitable\u0027. Devey concluded, early February 1877, that little could be done on account of its condition and outlook, recommending it be pulled down and a new hall placed on an elevated position to the North West. The architect produced plans that were not to his clients\u0027 satisfaction and following discussions, led by Mrs Corbet, a new design agreed.\r\nFour months following the inspection, in May 1877, the \u0027pulling down\u0027 of the old hall commenced with the digging of the cellars of the new. The materials from the demolition were put to good use, with much being used in the construction of the approved designs. The Victorian building was fashionably grand and made from red bricks – mostly made locally at works \"in the hole between the pool and the Church\".\r\nWindows and coping stones carved from stone were made from the portico columns that formed the entrance of the former building – this stone being of excellent quality and superior to other stone purchased from the quarry.\r\nCompletion, demise and demolition\r\nThe first bricks were laid on the 29th of August of 1877 and a year later much progress had been made. The building employed wood and lath and plaster partitions upon which the roof was supported. Some sources indicate that rotten flooring led to the demise of the property, leading to its demolition some 60 years later – it could be assumed that using the wooden partition to hold up the weight of the grand tiled roof may have led to structural issues if rot was indeed a factor in the decision to demolish in 1955.\r\nThe site can not be accessed from the public highway and the transfer of the land from the Corbet family was in 1958.\r\n\r\n"},{"docId":45,"docName":"Adderley.txt","content":"Adderley is a village and civil parish in the English county of Shropshire, several kilometres north of Market Drayton.

Eight years later, the band worked with Gravina to produce \"the winning sound\" on the album. He said the biggest challenge in recording was objectivity; choosing which songs to use, as well as improving their studio recording technique. Hudson told Australian Music Online that the band wanted people to \"draw from their own experiences\" when listening to Addicted Romantic, which they hoped contained music people would relate to. The Age\u0027s Andrew Murfett said the album was influenced by Joy Division, The Cure, The Smiths, and Echo \u0026 the Bunnymen, while Guy Blackman drew comparisons to Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party.Triple J\u0027s review of the album called it \"a dapper slice of post-mod power pop\".

The lyrics for \"Addicted to You\" were written by Kolehmainen\u0027s frequent collaborator Tracy Lipp alongside Janina Frostell, a model who was attempting a singing career: Frostell\u0027s album Impossible Love comprised songs she and Lipp co-wrote and \"Addicted to You\" was in fact written for Frostell\u0027s Impossible Love, her version being either never recorded and/or released once the potential of having a high-profile Finnish singer such as Laura Voutilainen make a Eurovision bid with the song was recognized.\r\n\"Addicted to You\" is sung from the perspective of a woman telling her lover how she feels about him. She seems amazed at the depth of her own feelings, telling him \"if you were a drug, I\u0027d be addicted to you\" and \"every time that we say \u0027goodbye\u0027, I just die a little inside\".\r\nFinland had last participated in Eurovision at Eurovision 2000 where the eighteenth place showing of Nina Åström with \"A Little Bit\" had resulted in a one-year Eurovision relegation for Finland.

The song was heavily promoted – reportedly more so than any previous Finnish Eurovision entrant – with Voutilainen showcasing her entry in several European countries, and expectations were high for its placing at Eurovision 2002 as exemplified by the contention by veteran Finnish singer Marion Rung – who had sung Finland\u0027s two highest scoring Eurovision entrants – that the final placing of \"Addicted to You\" at Eurovision 2002 would be higher than the sixth and seventh Eurovision placings earned by Rung with respectively \"Tipi-tii\" at Eurovision 1962 and \"Tom Tom Tom\" at Eurovision 1973 and that consequently \"Addicted to You\" would afford Finland a new Eurovision best.Performing thirteenth on the night of the Eurovision 2002 final, following Sweden\u0027s Afro-dite with \"Never Let It Go\" and preceding Denmark\u0027s Malene with \"Tell Me Who You Are\", Voutilainen was dressed in the colours of the Finnish flag, in a blue top and white trousers. The vocal quartet who supported Voutilainen included Sheidi, who had placed sixth in the Finnish national preliminary for Eurovision 2002 with \"Make the Rain\".At the close of voting, \"Addicted to You\" had received 24 points, placing 20th in a field of 24, thus disqualifying Finland from participation in the 2003 Contest.

Scholars such as Tom Shippey consider the theme to be modern, since in earlier times, power was considered to reveal character, not to alter it, recalling the English politician Lord Acton\u0027s 1887 statement that \"power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\".The corrupting effect of power in the book is not limited to the Ring. Sauron was already corrupted when he chose to put much of his power into the Ring to gain further control of Middle-earth. Some other characters are of an earlier time, and are unaffected by the Ring; the giant spider Shelob is unquestionably evil but uninterested in the Ring. The Wizard Saruman turns to evil and is wholly corrupted, lured by pride and power, but never gets the Ring.\r\nTolkien uses the Ring to illuminate the moral choices made by each character. Sméagol kills his friend Déagol to gain the Ring, and is corrupted by it, becoming wholly miserable as the monster Gollum. The virtuous warrior Boromir is seduced by the idea of using the Ring for good, and dies as a result. The Elf-lady Galadriel is greatly tempted, but rejects all use of the Ring.

The process of developing an addiction occurs through instrumental learning, which is otherwise known as operant conditioning.\r\nNeuroscientists believe that drug addicts’ behavior is a direct correlation to some physiological change in their brain, caused by using drugs. This view believes there is a bodily function in the brain causing the addiction. This is brought on by a change in the brain caused by brain damage or adaptation from chronic drug use.In humans, addiction is diagnosed according to diagnostic models such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, through observed behaviors. There has been significant advancement in understanding the structural changes that occur in parts of the brain involved in the reward pathway (mesolimbic system) that underlies addiction. Most research has focused on two portions of the brain: the ventral tegmental area, (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc).The VTA is the portion of the mesolimbic system responsible for spreading dopamine to the whole system. The VTA is stimulated by ″rewarding experiences″. The release of dopamine by the VTA induces pleasure, thus reinforcing behaviors that lead to the reward. Drugs of abuse increase the VTA\u0027s ability to project dopamine to the rest of the reward circuit. These structural changes only last 7–10 days, however, indicating that the VTA cannot be the only part of the brain that is affected by drug use, and changed during the development of addiction.\r\nThe nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an essential part in the formation of addiction. Almost every drug with addictive potential induces the release of dopamine into the NAc. In contrast to the VTA, the NAc shows long-term structural changes. Drugs of abuse weaken the connections within the NAc after habitual use, as well as after use then withdrawal.\r\n"},{"docId":59,"docName":"Addiction.txt","content":"Addiction is a biopsychosocial disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences. A variety of complex neurobiological and psychosocial factors are implicated in the development of addiction, with the predominant paradigm among researchers in the United States being the Brain Disease model, though debate exists within the field over relative contribution of any given factor. Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences. Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, marijuana addiction, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opioid addiction, food addiction, chocolate addiction, video game addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction. The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 and the ICD-10 is gambling addiction. With the introduction of the ICD-11 gaming addiction was appended. The term \"addiction\" is frequently misused when referring to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media. An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use. Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal. Addiction can occur in the absence of dependence, and dependence can occur in the absence of addiction, although the two often occur together.\r\n"},{"docId":60,"docName":"Addictive personality.txt","content":"An addictive personality refers to a hypothesized set of personality traits that make an individual predisposed to developing addictions. This hypothesis states that there may be common personality traits observable in people suffering from addiction; however, the lack of a universally agreed upon definition has marked the research surrounding addictive personality. Addiction is a fairly broad term; it is most often associated with substance use disorders, but it can also be extended to cover a number of other compulsive behaviors, including sex, internet, television, gambling, food, and shopping. Within these categories of addiction a common diagnostic scale involves tolerance, withdraw, and cravings. This is a fairly contentious topic, with many experts suggesting the term be retired due to a lack of cumulative evidence supporting the existence of addictive personality. Stating that characteristics of personality attributed to addictive personality do not predict addiction, but can result from addiction. However, different personality traits have been linked to various types of addictive behaviors, suggesting that individual addictions may be associated with different personality profiles. The strongest consensus is that genetic factors play the largest role in determining a predisposition for addictive behaviors. Even then, however, genes play different roles in different types of addictions. Forty to seventy percent of the population variance in the expression of addictions can be explained by genetic factors.\r\n"},{"docId":61,"docName":"Addie E.

For Pascal, this was an adding machine that could perform additions and subtractions directly and multiplication and divisions by repetitions, whilst Schickard\u0027s machine, invented several decades earlier, was less functionally efficient but was supported by a mechanised form of multiplication tables. These two were followed by a series of inventors and inventions leading to those of Thomas de Colmar, who launched the mechanical calculator industry in 1851 when he released his simplified arithmometer (it took him thirty years to refine his machine, patented in 1820, into a simpler and more reliable form).  However, they did not gain widespread use until Dorr E. Felt started manufacturing his comptometer (1887) and Burroughs started the commercialization of differently conceived adding machines (1892).\r\n"},{"docId":67,"docName":"Addingham.txt","content":"Addingham (formerly Haddincham c. 972, Odingehem 1086) is a village and civil parish in the English county of West Yorkshire. It is situated near the A65, 6 miles (10 km) south east of Skipton, 3 miles (5 km) west of Ilkley, 19 miles (31 km) north west of Bradford and around 20 miles (32 km) north west of Leeds. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is located in the valley of the River Wharfe and is only 1 mile (2 km) from the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The name is thought to mean \"homestead associated with a man called Adda\", although in the Domesday Book, the village was referred to as \"Ediham\", which may have referred to Earl Edwin of Bolton Abbey. The 2001 census numbered Addingham\u0027s population at 3,599, increasing to 3,730 at the 2011 Census.The area around Addingham is thought to have been populated from at least Bronze Age times, indicated by the \u0027cup and ring\u0027 carved stones that can be found on Addingham Moor. Its beginnings may date back to the late Mesolithic period, as evidenced by the scattered remains of early flint tools across Rombald\u0027s Moor to the south.The earliest of the existing houses were built in the 17th century when the village was a farming community, but the real growth began in the late 18th century and early 19th century when the textile industry arrived and five working mills, plus other loomshops and weaving sheds, were established, and the village developed into a busy industrial community. The village grew up around three centres; Church Street in the east; The Green, about a mile away in the west; and the Old School in between. This is thought to be one of the reasons the village used to be known as \"Long Addingham\".\r\nSince the decline of the textile industry during the 20th century, the village has now become largely a commuter and retirement community. It is home to an award-winning Medical Centre, a public park, four public houses, several retirement homes and a solitary school, Addingham Primary School.\r\n"},{"docId":68,"docName":"Addington Davenport.txt","content":"Addington Davenport (August 3, 1670 – April 3, 1736) was a Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1715 to 1736.\r\nDavenport was born in Boston on August 3, 1670, to Eleazer and Rebecca (née Addington) Davenport.

The hospital was created by the Australian obstetrician and gynaecologists Catherine Hamlin, and her husband Reginald Hamlin, to care for women with childbirth injuries and has been in operation since 1974. It is in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. It is the only hospital of its kind in the world dedicated exclusively to women with obstetric fistula (a condition common in the developing world where the maternal health provisions are poor), and it treats all patients free of charge. Patients undergo surgical repair by Ethiopian and expatriate surgeons trained at the hospital\u0027s main facility in Addis Ababa. Around 93% of these patients are successfully treated.In addition to the main hospital in Ethiopia\u0027s capital, Hamlin has opened five hospitals in the Ethiopian cities of Bahir Dar, Mekele, Yirgalem, Harrar and Metu. All 6 hospitals provide a safe birthing facility where former patients who fall pregnant can have a caesarian section.

The name comes from agape, a Greek term for \u0027love\u0027 in its broadest sense. The plural agapae or agapæ has been used by itself in reference to lovefeasts, but is ambiguous, as it can also mean funerary gatherings.\r\nThe lovefeast custom originated in the early Church and was a time of fellowship for believers. The Eucharist was often a part of the lovefeast, although at some point (probably between the latter part of the 1st century AD and 250 AD), the two became separate. Thus, in modern times the Lovefeast refers to a Christian ritual meal distinct from the Lord\u0027s Supper. The lovefeast seeks to strengthen the bonds and the spirit of harmony, goodwill, and congeniality, as well as to forgive past disputes and instead love one another.The practice of the lovefeast is mentioned in Jude 1:12 of the Christian Bible and was a \"common meal of the early church\". References to communal meals are discerned in 1 Corinthians 11:17–34, in Saint Ignatius of Antioch\u0027s Letter to the Smyrnaeans, where the term agape is used, and in a letter from Pliny the Younger to Trajan, (ca. 111 A.D.) in which he reported that the Christians, after having met \"on a stated day\" in the early morning to \"address a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity\", later in the day would \"reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal\". Similar communal meals are attested also in the Apostolic tradition often attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, who does not use the term agape, and in works of Tertullian, who does. The connection between such substantial meals and the Eucharist had virtually ceased by the time of Cyprian (died 258), when the Eucharist was celebrated with fasting in the morning and the agape in the evening. The Synod of Gangra in 340 makes mention of lovefeasts in relation to a heretic who had barred his followers from attending them.Though still mentioned in the Quinisext Council of 692, the agape fell into disuse soon after, except among the churches in Ethiopia and India. At the end of the 18th century the Carmelite friar Paolino da San Bartolomeo reported that the ancient Saint Thomas Christians of India still celebrated the lovefeast, using their typical dish called appam. In addition, Radical Pietist groups originating in the eighteenth-century, such as the Schwarzenau Brethren and the Moravian Church, celebrate the lovefeast. Methodist churches also continue the practice.The practice has been revived more recently among other groups, including Anglicans, as well as the American house church movement.

It was named from the Greek: agapemone meaning \"abode of love\". The Agapemone community was founded by the Reverend Henry Prince in Spaxton, Somerset. The sect also built a church in Upper Clapton, London, and briefly had bases in Stoke-by-Clare in Suffolk, Brighton and Weymouth.\r\nThe ideas of the community were based on the theories of various German religious mystics and its primary object was the spiritualisation of the matrimonial state. The Church of England had dismissed Prince earlier in his career for his radical teachings. The Agapemonites predicted the imminent return of Jesus Christ. According to newspaper accounts, Prince\u0027s successor, John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, declared himself Jesus Christ\u0027s reincarnation.\r\nThe Agapemone community consisted mostly of wealthy unmarried women. Both Prince and Smyth-Pigott took many spiritual brides. Later investigations have shown that these \"brides\" were not solely spiritual and that some produced illegitimate children. In 1860, Prince lost a lawsuit brought on behalf of Louisa Nottidge by the Nottidge family  and the group vanished from the public eye.

It is about 11 millimeters long.

Hindwings are dark grey.Julius von Kennel provides a full description. The adult lives for only a few days, during which time the female lays eggs on stems and leaves. The larva, a root miner, moves to the root of the plant and tunnels through the cortex as it feeds. This causes moderate damage to the plant.\r\n\r\nThis moth is native to Eurasia. It was introduced to the western and west-central United States starting in the 1980s and it is now established in knapweed populations.

This association later resulted in abuses and scandals, so that councils of the fourth century forbade it. The Council of Ancyra, in 314, forbade virgins consecrated to God to live thus with men as sisters. This did not correct the practice entirely, for St. Jerome arraigns Syrian monks for living in cities with Christian virgins. The Agapetae are sometimes confounded with the subintroductae, or woman who lived with clerics without marriage, a class against which the third canon of the First Council of Nicaea (325) was directed. The practice of clerics living with unrelated women was finally condemned by the First and Second  Lateran Councils.The Agapetae were also a branch of the Gnostics in the late 4th century, who held that sexual relations were only improper if the mind was impure. They taught that one should perjure himself rather than reveal the secrets of his sect.\r\n"},{"docId":107,"docName":"Agapetes serpens.txt","content":"Agapetes serpens is a semi-climbing shrub species native to the Himalayas, 40–60 cm tall, grown as an ornamental for its attractive pendulous benches of red tubular flowers blooming over a long period.

The book deals in general terms with the moral, religious, and political duties of a ruler.  In form it is quite sententious and rhetorical, and resembles closely a similar work in the romance of Barlaam and Josaphat. Both of these seem to be based on Isocrates, and on Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus.\r\nThe work of Agapetus was eminently fitted for the use of medieval teachers by reason of its content, the purity of its Greek diction, and its skillful construction.

The black woodpecker is easily the largest woodpecker species in Europe as well as in the portion of Asia where it lives and is one of the largest species worldwide. This non-migratory species tends to make its home in old-growth forest or large forest stands and excavates a large tree hole to reside in.  In turn, several species rely on black woodpeckers to secondarily reside in the holes made in trees by them. This woodpeckers diet consists mostly of carpenter ants. This species is closely related to, and fills the same ecological niche in Europe as, the pileated woodpecker of North America and the lineated woodpecker of South America, also being similar to the white-bellied woodpecker which is distributed to the south somewhat of the black woodpecker in Asia.\r\n"},{"docId":228,"docName":"Blister hangar.txt","content":"A blister hangar is a novel arched, portable aircraft hangar designed by notable British airport architect Graham R Dawbarn patented by Miskins and Sons in 1939.

It is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate\u0027s body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion. Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\r\nPhysiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body\u0027s other organs. They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.\r\nThe operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved. Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.\r\nThis article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.\r\n"},{"docId":243,"docName":"Brazilian Gold Rush.txt","content":"The Brazilian Gold Rush was a gold rush that started in the 1690s, in the then Portuguese colony of Brazil in the Portuguese Empire. The gold rush opened up the major gold-producing area of Ouro Preto (Portuguese for black gold), then known as Vila Rica. Eventually, the Brazilian Gold Rush created the world\u0027s longest gold rush period and the largest gold mines in South America.\r\nThe rush began when bandeirantes discovered large gold deposits in the mountains of Minas Gerais. The bandeirantes were adventurers who organized themselves into small groups to explore the interior of Brazil. Many bandeirantes were of mixed indigenous and European background who adopted the ways of the natives, which permitted them to survive in the interior. While the bandeirantes searched for indigenous captives, they also searched for mineral wealth, which led to the gold being discovered.\r\nMore than 400,000 Portuguese and 500,000 African slaves came to the gold region to mine. Many people abandoned the sugar plantations and towns in the northeast coast to go to the gold region. By 1725, half the population of Brazil was living in southeastern Brazil.\r\nOfficially, 800 metric tons of gold were sent to Portugal in the 18th century. Other gold circulated illegally, and still other gold remained in the colony to adorn churches and for other uses.The municipality of Ouro Preto became the most populous city of Latin America, counting on about 40 thousand people in 1730 and, decades after, 80 thousand. At that time, the population of New York was less than half of that number of inhabitants and the population of São Paulo did not surpass 8 thousand.Minas Gerais was the gold mining center of Brazil. Slave labor was generally used for the workforce. The discovery of gold in the area caused a huge influx of European immigrants and the government decided to bring in bureaucrats from Portugal to control operations. They set up numerous bureaucracies, often with conflicting duties and jurisdictions. The officials generally proved unequal to the task of controlling this highly lucrative industry. In 1830, the St. John d\u0027el Rey Mining Company, controlled by the British, opened the largest gold mine in Latin America. The British brought in modern management techniques and engineering expertise. Located in Nova Lima, the mine produced ore for 125 years.\r\n"},{"docId":244,"docName":"Breton Regionalist Union.txt","content":"The Breton regionalist union (Union Régionaliste Bretonne or URB) was a Breton cultural and political organisation created August 16, 1898.

Canteen Boy is a naive, childlike assistant scoutmaster with an acute attention to detail. He is always seen with a full scout\u0027s uniform and a canteen around his neck.  Canteen Boy is routinely mocked by other characters in the sketch, who are well aware that their jokes will be lost on the character. It appears he lacks self-confidence, such as one time when he was called an idiot he proceeds to call the bully an idiot too, only to say he said nothing when the bully threatens him. His revenge toward these bullies often ties into his skills as an outdoorsman. Canteen Boy is a master at snake-calling, and he enjoys the television show Seaquest. He has also said in passing that he very much admires Cheryl Tiegs. A sketch would often end with either Canteen Boy finding a snake or his tormentors having to run away from a sudden onslaught of snakes. Sandler later stated that there is nothing wrong with Canteen Boy, rather he is \"someone who has been in the Scouts too long\". Although the word \u0027boy\u0027 in the character\u0027s name suggests he\u0027s a child, it has been made clear that Canteen Boy is actually a 27-year-old man who still lives with his mom and is still active in the Boy Scouts. Since he is overage to be an active Scout, he is actually a Scout leader. However this was contradicted in a brief bit where Chris Farley plays a fellow Scout, and it is assumed Farley was meant to be a teenager.\r\nThe season 19 Valentine\u0027s Day episode hosted by Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had a sketch where Baldwin played Mr. Armstrong, a scoutmaster who made overt sexual advances toward Canteen Boy. NBC received many complaints about the skit, saying that it was homophobic and trivialized pedophilia. Actual molestation did not occur, as Canteen Boy had clearly understood what was happening and was ill at ease with Mr. Armstrong\u0027s attitude. The sketch ends with Canteen Boy running off into the woods. The controversial sketch became the subject of Baldwin\u0027s monologue the next time he hosted on December 10, 1994.\r\nIn the VHS Best of Adam Sandler release, a disclaimer is added that explicitly states that Canteen Boy is 27 years old and that the sketch is based on actual events (with some elements added in for dramatic effect). This disclaimer has also been put in the NBC 90-minute rerun, the version shown on the Best of Alec Baldwin DVD, and versions shown on NBC\u0027s SNL app as well as on Netflix and Hulu.

Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as \"satisfied, not satisfied, unsure\") are often displayed in a pie chart, but maybe more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart.

It was intended to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as a ray of hope, and somehow managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.\r\nThe Ellesmere Canal was also building branches in North Wales, which were intended to link up to the River Dee at Chester, but eventually linked to the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich, in 1805. The canal then became the middle section of a much longer and more profitable canal. The two companies merged in 1813, becoming the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. When the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was proposed in 1826, which would provide a link from Nantwich to Wolverhampton and the Birmingham canal system, the company saw it as an opportunity to build the Middlewich Branch, which would provide a connection to Manchester and the Potteries. The branch opened in 1833, and the Junction Canal opened in 1835. Amalgamation followed in 1845, with the new company retaining the name of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. The following year, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company was formed from the Ellesmere and Chester company, which also took over a number of canals which joined theirs. Plans to convert some of the canals to railways were put on hold in the 1847, when the canal company was leased to the London and North Western Railway. Under railway control, the canals continued to operate successfully, but decline set in during the 20th century, and when many of the adjoining canals were closed in 1944, the sections which had been the Ellesmere and Chester Canal and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, together with the Middlewich Branch, were retained.\r\nThe canals were nationalised in 1948, and long-distance commercial traffic had all but ended by 1958. In 1963, the British Waterways Board was formed and the canal ceased to be operated by railway interests for the first time in over 100 years. It was designated as a cruising waterway in the Transport Act 1968, with potential for leisure use, and since then, it has been enjoyed by recreational boaters, by walkers and by fishermen. In 1997, the Chester Canal Heritage Trust was formed and has worked to promote the canal and its heritage.

Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.\r\nThe plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.

Much of the gold used for the gold leaf dome of the Georgia State Capitol was mined at this mine, which was among the most productive mines in the Georgia Gold Belt.  The mine is located just north of the site of the Consolidated Mine, which is itself north of the Calhoun Mine.  \r\nIn 1969, the owners of Crisson Mine opened to the public to allow tourists to pan for gold.

This tool can illuminate the presence of contradictions in processes that cannot be detected by any single questionnaire item using a traditional format such as the Likert scale. The diamond of opposites is a sociometric scaling method that simultaneously measures positive and negative responses to a statement.\r\nPsychodrama/Sociometry: \r\nThe psychological approach to counseling and exploring issues, both personal and in a wider social context, was founded by J.L. Moreno in the 1920s.  His unique approach to therapy and social change at that time involved using theater and roleplay to assist individuals and groups to change/ improve their life circumstances, and a somewhat lesser known approach, called Sociometry,  to measuring social dynamics in groups, and effect change in groups and society.  Sociometry measures the connections between individuals in any group, from small groups to world issues.  Measuring connections and feelings within a group assists individuals within the group to make desired/ needed changes, and also provides a wealth of information about the dynamics in any particular group or situation.  The Diamond of Opposites is one type of sociometric assessment.\r\nUnlike traditional question formats, especially the semantic differential format where the respondent must choose a point on a one-dimensional scale anchored by two semantically opposite terms, the diamond of opposites allows the respondent to express attraction and repulsion independently. In this format, the stem describes an object, person or situation in relation to which the respondent is asked to indicate their degree of attraction and repulsion. The two variables are plotted on two orthogonal axes.\r\n"},{"docId":412,"docName":"Diaphania fuscicollis.txt","content":"Diaphania fuscicollis is a moth in the family Crambidae.

It is claimed that \"[a] person with a very sensitive body may also have some subtle reaction to whatever animals react to\". Proponents have speculated that these may result from: 1) piezoelectric effects due to changes in the stress of the earth\u0027s crust, 2) low-frequency electromagnetic signals, or 3) from the emission of radon gas.\r\nAlthough proponents suggest the possibility that the claimed effects might work through known physical phenomena, and thus be amenable to scientific study, these claims are pseudoscientific in that no evidence of such effects, nor any theory of how such effects might be perceived, has been presented in the scientific literature. What the scientific literature does have is various reports showing that animals do not show disturbed or altered behavior attributable to earthquake precursors (other than foreshocks). Aside from whether such phenomena can be detected (by any means), the \"consistent failure to find reliable earthquake precursors\" has led many scientists to question whether such precursor phenomena even exist.\r\nCould \"earthquake sensitives\" be responding to some kind of \"psychic impressions\" or other paranormal phenomena as yet unknown to science? After reviewing the scientific literature the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF) concluded that there is no credible scientific evidence that animals display behaviors indicative of earthquake-related environmental disturbances that are unobservable by the physical and chemical sensor systems available to earthquake scientists.\r\nOn their side, the proponents claim that there have been \"many scientific papers\" supporting their views, but \"most have been totally rejected by the keepers of high wisdom.\" While scientists are quick to dismiss theories they \"know, or have good reason to believe, are not credible\", and especially predictions by amateurs on account of their lack of scientific rigor,\r\nproponents claim that successful predictions can indicate a significant breakthrough, even if the details are not understood. In this regard Berkland claims \"a 75 percent accuracy rate of forecasting quakes.\" However, these results (besides being disputed) are irrelevant in demonstrating any kind of \"earthquake sensitive\" effect as Berkland\u0027s predictions appear to not involve such effects.Berkland ceased posting his predictions after June 2010. Though a few others have continued to post their predictions on Berkland\u0027s website, there appears to be no effort to correlate \"ear tones\" or any other physiological effect with subsequent earthquakes.\r\n"},{"docId":436,"docName":"East London Tech City.txt","content":"East London Tech City (also known as Tech City and Silicon Roundabout) is a technology cluster of high-tech companies located in East London, United Kingdom.

It was originally bred by Iolo Owen in Angelsey by crossing Nelson Welsh Mountain sheep (a Welsh Mountain and Cheviot cross) which were crossed twice to the Wiltshire Horn, which is a wool-shedding breed. The progeny were selected for: wool shedding, no horns, and easy-care traits, reduced need for assistance at lambing, less flystrike and lameness. Some Easycare breeders are now selecting for sheep that need less worming. \r\nMost animals in the wild thicken up their coats in winter and then moult when spring comes, but many modern sheep breeds were selectively bred for thick coats which are retained for shearing.  With the decline in the worldwide wool markets, a thick coat is now less desirable, especially where the cost of shearing is higher than the value of the wool produced.  In this respect, the Easycare breed is an interesting reversal of centuries of practice in sheep breed development as the sheep naturally shed their coats in spring, a process called rooing. Unlike many other sheep breeds, Easycare sheep can live without the necessity of shearing.\r\n"},{"docId":440,"docName":"Easyday.txt","content":"Easyday is an Indian retail brand that runs chains of consumer retail supermarkets and convenience stores.

Forest products are obtained along the coast, and mining for silver, gold, mercury, copper, and precious stones is an important activity. The beverage tequila, distilled from the juice of the agave cactus, is named for the town of that name in Jalisco and is one of the state’s best-known products. Since the state is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, tourism is an important economic engine.  In 2006 20 million local and international tourists visited the state, contributing to an economic revenue of 25 billion pesos, 11% higher than in 2005. Guadalajara is served by one of the country’s busiest airports and is one of the state’s major tourist centres. Puerto Vallarta is a popular tourist destination among young students. The state ranks number three in terms of nominal GDP behind Nuevo León State. Since the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 the state has been experiencing a high rate of investment. Jalisco, like many other industrial states in the country, has evolved from a producer of cheap, low-quality goods into an exporter of sophisticated products, from auto brake systems to laptop computers. 86% of the population is urban, higher than the national average of 76%.\r\n"},{"docId":469,"docName":"Ectatomma ruidum.txt","content":"Ectatomma ruidum is a Neotropical species of ant in the subfamily Ectatomminae.\r\n"},{"docId":470,"docName":"Ed Garland.txt","content":"Edward Bertram Garland (January 9, 1895 – January 22, 1980) was a New Orleans jazz string bass player.

The focus in past research tended to be on the unique ideas and knowledge of minorities and distinct cultural groups, and how this relates to universal and cross cultural knowledge discovered by humanity as a whole.  Knowledge claims that are based more on universal discoveries and natural science can be found in the subjects of philosophy, chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and geology. The term \"ethnogeology\" first enters the geological literature through the work of John Murray of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in the mid-1990s by virtue of his studies of the Northern Cree First Nation geological worldviews in the Province of Manitoba in Canada. At that time, a cadre of geologists and geoscience educators - particularly Dr. Steven Semken of Navajo Community College in Shiprock, New Mexico and colleagues - were examining the interesting connections among Native American traditional knowledge, geoscience concepts, and the unique vision of planet Earth\u0027s history as articulated by indigenous ethnogeological wisdom (see references below).\r\nOne global example of geological knowledge over thousands of years is the making of rock tools and arrowheads.  Worldwide, humans have shaped specific kinds of rock into various tools.  These artifacts are evidence that there was some basic knowledge of which rocks were hard enough and easy enough to chip into various useful forms.  Ancient humans discovered certain rock formations that provided them with materials to work with.  Flint, obsidian, chert, copper and quartz were some examples of useful rocks or minerals for thousands of years.\r\nIn addition, humans have always used natural, high, and dry ridges for land transportation.  Natural water ways were used for boats, travel, exploration, and trade.  Various types of natural elements were used around the Earth for centuries.

During FY2017, the federal government spent $3.98 trillion, up $128 billion or 3.3% vs. FY2016 spending of $3.85 trillion. Major categories of FY 2017 spending included: Healthcare such as Medicare and Medicaid ($1,077B or 27% of spending), Social Security ($939B or 24%), non-defense discretionary spending used to run federal Departments and Agencies ($610B or 15%), Defense Department ($590B or 15%), and interest ($263B or 7%).Expenditures are classified as \"mandatory\", with payments required by specific laws to those meeting eligibility criteria (e.g., Social Security and Medicare), or \"discretionary\", with payment amounts renewed annually as part of the budget process, such as defense. Around two thirds of federal spending is for \"mandatory\" programs. CBO projects that mandatory program spending and interest costs will rise relative to GDP over the 2016–2026 period, while defense and other discretionary spending will decline relative to GDP.\r\n"},{"docId":507,"docName":"Extended BIOS.txt","content":"Extended BIOS may refer to:\r\n\r\nXIOS, the extended BIOS in Digital Research\u0027s MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS and REAL/32 (since 1979)\r\nXBIOS, the extended BIOS in Atari TOS-based computers (since 1984/1985)\r\nEX-BIOS, non-standard BIOS extensions in the HP Vectra series of computers (since 1985)\r\n"},{"docId":508,"docName":"Eysseric.txt","content":"Eysseric is a French surname.

He represented Knoxdale-Merivale Ward.  On January 31, 2010, he announced that he would not be running re-election to city council in 2010.\r\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Hunter was born into a military family and moved frequently during his childhood. He attended Lakefield College School, Dalhousie University, and University of Toronto, graduating in 1968. He moved to Nepean in 1968 to become a teacher at Confederation High School, and taught physical education there for thirty-one years until the school closed in 1999. He was also a national champion at orienteering.\r\nHe ran for the federal Liberal Party in the 1980 federal election, but lost to Progressive Conservative Walter Baker by more than 12,000 votes. He ran again in the 1984 federal election, and lost by almost 21,000 votes. (This was the election where the Progressive Conservatives swept to power with a majority government.)\r\nHunter entered municipal politics in 1980 when he was elected to the Nepean City Council as well as to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton Council. He was easily reelected in every election thereafter: 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997.\r\nDuring the 1980s when the Non-Smoking Bylaw was on the agenda at the Nepean City Hall (non-smoking areas in restaurants) Garfield Mahood, executive director of Non-Smokers\u0027 Rights Association, amongst other health experts, attempted to persuade Hunter to support the bylaw. However, Hunter steadfastly refused to support a non-smoking bylaw.\r\nIn 1994, as a result of local government reorganization, Hunter moved to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton Council. A Liberal, he ran for the party in the 1999 provincial election in the riding of Nepean—Carleton, but lost to Tory incumbent John Baird. He was, however, regarded as one of the more fiscally conservative councillors.\r\nWith the creation of the new city of Ottawa, in 2000, Hunter ran to represent the Knoxdale-Merivale ward, and easily won election against an anti-development activist. In the 2003 municipal election, he was re-elected with 84% of the vote.\r\nHunter was opposed to the city\u0027s O-Train light-rail expansion which would have linked Barrhaven South to downtown in 2009, before it was cancelled by City Council on December 14, 2006. Hunter expressed concerns about high costs on the project as well as the ridership. On December 8, 2006, Hunter voted against a plan that would have truncated only the downtown segment of the proposal and later introduced another vote to topple the complete project which failed. On December 14, 2006, after Mayor Larry O\u0027Brien decided to vote against the project, Hunter voted for the cancellation of the project. [1] [2]\r\n[3]\r\nMeanwhile, on Feb. 22, 2007, on CFRA\u0027s \"The Lunch Bunch\", Hunter said he may have accepted a campaign contribution from the Siemens/PCL consortium (Ottawa LRT Corporation)..\r\nGord Hunter was also criticized for the appearance of a conflict of interest for having accepted a free corporate box seat at the 2007 Stanley Cup NHL hockey playoff game (Senators v.s.

The City of Ottawa Policy states: \"employees must not accept, directly or indirectly, any gifts, hospitality or other benefits that are offered by persons, groups or organizations having dealings with the city.\"  However, other than addressing corruption, the provincial Municipal Act does not prohibit councillors from accepting such gifts.\r\nIt was revealed in a report of the City of Ottawa\u0027s 2007 office budget spending by city councillors that Gord Hunter spent the least.  According to the Ottawa Sun (April 1, 2008): \"The most frugal on the list is always Knoxdale-Merivale Coun. Gord Hunter and 2007 was no exception.

In the story, Himari is shown to be a bakeneko or demon cat, a type of Japanese spirit known as a yōkai. Reception of her character by English-language media has been mostly positive with writers often calling her a good lead character based on her traits.\r\nIn both the anime and manga series she is the descendant of a yōkai that was spared rather than being killed by a demon slayer family. As a result, she and her ancestors have sworn to protect its members. Yuto Amakawa, being the current heir to the family, is thus under her care. As the series progresses she shows that she deeply cares for and loves Yuto, but struggles with demons within herself. At the end of the series, Yuto saves Himari and confesses his love back to her.

Isomalt may prove upsetting to the intestinal tract because it is incompletely absorbed in the small intestine, and when polyols pass into the large intestine, they can cause osmotically-induced diarrhea and stimulate the gut flora, causing flatulence. As with dietary fibers, regular consumption of isomalt can lead to desensitization, decreasing the risk of intestinal upset.Isomalt has been approved for use in the United States since 1990.

It is the second newest of four mines operated by the company, having begun operations in 1982.\r\nJwaneng is an open pit mine. The mine produces 9.3 million tons per year of ore and an additional 37 million tons per year of waste rock. The mine is located on three kimberlite pipes that converge near the surface, covering 520,000 square metres at ground level. Currently, the mine produces approximately 11 million carats (2,200 kg) of diamonds. The recoverable ore grade at the mine is about 1.25 carats per ton (250 mg/t). As of 2005, known reserves will allow production at current levels to continue for 27 years. The high rate of diamond extraction, combined with high quality diamonds fetching excellent per weight prices, make the Jwaneng diamond mine the richest diamond mine in the world by value of recovered diamonds.\r\nJwaneng employs over 2,100 people. The mine also owns and operates a local hospital and Jwaneng Airport. The mine maintains an ISO 14001 certificate for environmental compliance, being the first mine in Botswana to achieve this certification in 2000. Jwaneng is known for its excellent safety record, winning multiple national and international safety awards.The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) instrument on NASA’s Landsat 7 satellite acquired this image of the Jwaneng Diamond Mine on May 17, 2001.

She eventually returned on 24 December 2016, just over 21 years since her first exit—with Jenna Russell taking over the role this time around before leaving the serial once again on 17 April 2018.\r\nOver the course of her original stint, Michelle had made some huge mistakes during her time in Albert Square—mainly over her habit of choosing the wrong men and then displaying a stubborn nature to the point where she rarely accepted help or listened to good advice. Despite this, she is portrayed as a determined and outspoken character who has never been afraid to defend herself or her beliefs. This is thoroughly explored through Michelle\u0027s longstanding companionship with her best-friend Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean).\r\nIn her first major storyline with Susan\u0027s portrayal of the character, Michelle ended up getting pregnant at the age of 16 and it was soon revealed that the father of her baby was in fact Sharon\u0027s adopted father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham).

Favored habitat is well-oxygenated and clear water, such as over gravel riffles in mountain streams, springs, and along rocky lake shores.\r\nSpawning takes place during early winter and late spring. The male\u0027s head becomes darker, and he selects a protected nest site, such as under a rock or ledge. After courtship, the female enters the nest, turns upside down, and deposits her eggs on the ceiling, where they adhere. Typically several females will deposit eggs in a nest, then the male fertilizes and guards them, fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins.\r\nMottled sculpin occurrence is discontinuous in its range.

Although the regime had many ideological influences (Traditionalism, National Catholicism, Militarism and National syndicalism), it employed Falangism in its popular movements. Falangist ideology was easily incorporated in the creation of mottos as it is believed to demonstrate a certain reluctance towards political agendas, and to favour empiricism, taking action, and the simplification of ideas.Although these mottos originated from the activity of different right-wing intellectuals and nationalist political parties during the Second Spanish Republic, their use became widespread and proved to be an effective propaganda tool used by the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) in mobilising public opinion and persuading the population to conform to nationalist ideas. Mottos were also often used as political chants during Franco\u0027s dictatorship (1939–1975).\r\nAs well as achieving military victory, the Rebel, or Nationalist, faction successfully used propaganda to link the term \"national\" with the concept of Spain itself. This is a result of the extended period of time the regime stayed in power in the absence of any public resistance, despite clandestine opposition. Those within the regime did not all blindly support such simplifications as demonstrated in España como problema by the Falangist intellectual, Pedro Laín Entralgo. Rafael Calvo Serer responded to this with his España sin problema, expressing traditional and orthodox beliefs. These beliefs had to be adopted, as assuming a traditional stance and showcasing \u0027unwavering support\u0027 towards Franco was the only way to maintain any semblance of power, as highlighted by Luis Carrero Blanco when referring to Franco and everything the Caudillo represented:\r\n\r\n  [...] my loyalty to [Franco] and his work is undoubtedly sincere and completely transparent; it is unconstrained by limitations, nor is it affected by doubts or reservations [...]During Spain\u0027s transition to democracy, not only were Francoism\u0027s mottos and symbols abandoned, but there was also a decline in the use of national symbols in general.

Motu Nui is the summit of a large volcanic mountain which rises over 2,000 meters from the sea bed. It measures 3.9 hectares in land area and is the largest of the five satellite islets of Easter island.\r\n\r\nThe ritual of the \"Bird Man\" cult was a competition to collect the first egg of the manutara. This took place starting from Motu Nui where the Hopu (representatives from each clan) waited for the sooty terns to lay their first eggs of the season. The Hopu who seized the first egg raced to swim back to Easter Island, climbed the cliffs to Orongo and presented the egg to their sponsor in front of the judges at Orongo. This gave their sponsor the title of Tangata manu and great power on the island for a year. Many Hopu were killed by sharks or by falling. The winning clan gained certain rights, including the collecting of eggs and young birds from the islets.\r\nMotu means \"island\" in Rapa Nui language, and there are two smaller motus located nearby: Motu Kao Kao (a sea stack, rising around 20 meters (65 feet) above sea level) and Motu Iti (near Motu Nui).\r\nMotu Nui was scientifically surveyed by the Routledge expedition of 1914, which reported that six other varieties of seabirds nested there in addition to the sooty tern. They explored two caves on Motu Nui, in one of which the Hopu used to stay while waiting for the first egg of the season, and the other used to contain Moai Maea \"The Boundary of the Land\", a small moai that had already been taken to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, England.\r\nAlthough the Tangata Manu cult\u0027s rituals have long since been discontinued (the last competition known to have taken place in 1888), current visitors to Rapa Nui often enjoy the beauty of the Motus via small boat excursions from Hanga Roa, the island\u0027s only town. The diving in the sea between Motu Nui and Kau Kau is exceptional, and is a highly sought-after scuba diving location for dive enthusiasts from around the world.

In recognition of this royal connection, the college has also been historically known as King\u0027s College and King\u0027s Hall. The reigning monarch of the United Kingdom (since 1952, Elizabeth II) is the official visitor of the college.The original medieval foundation established in 1324 by Adam de Brome, under the patronage of King Edward II of England, was the House of the Blessed Mary at Oxford, and the college received a royal charter in 1326.: 1  In 1329, an additional royal grant of a manor house, La Oriole, eventually gave rise to its common name. The first design allowed for a provost and ten fellows, called \"scholars\", and the college remained a small body of graduate fellows until the 16th century, when it started to admit undergraduates. During the English Civil War, Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the king\u0027s Oxford Parliament.The main site of the college incorporates four medieval halls: Bedel Hall, St Mary Hall, St Martin Hall, and Tackley\u0027s Inn, the last being the oldest standing medieval hall in Oxford.: 2  The college has nearly 40 fellows, about 300 undergraduates and some 250 graduates. Oriel was the last of Oxford\u0027s men\u0027s colleges to admit women in 1985, after more than six centuries as an all-male institution. Today, however, the student body has almost equal numbers of men and women. Oriel\u0027s notable alumni include two Nobel laureates; prominent fellows have included founders of the Oxford Movement.

A space is orientable if such a consistent definition exists. In this case, there are two possible definitions, and a choice between them is an orientation of the space. Real vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, and spheres are orientable. A space is non-orientable if \"clockwise\" is changed into \"counterclockwise\" after running through some loops in it, and coming back to the starting point. This means that a geometric shape, such as , that moves continuously along such a loop is changed in its own mirror image . A Möbius strip is an example of a non-orientable space.\r\nVarious equivalent formulations of orientability can be given, depending on the desired application and level of generality. Formulations applicable to general topological manifolds often employ methods of homology theory, whereas for differentiable manifolds more structure is present, allowing a formulation in terms of differential forms.  A generalization of the notion of orientability of a space is that of orientability of a family of spaces parameterized by some other space (a fiber bundle) for which an orientation must be selected in each of the spaces which varies continuously with respect to changes in the parameter values.\r\n"},{"docId":1245,"docName":"Oriental (Albéniz).txt","content":"Oriental, Op. 232, No. 2, is a composition by Isaac Albéniz.\r\nIt was written for piano, in the key of D minor, as part of the suite Chants d\u0027Espagne.

Many landmarks were built over the 20th century, such as the grand streamlined moderne houses like the Olympus building and the Anscombe Apartments, and the modernist Freyberg pool built in the 1960s (which jets out onto the harbour and is named about Lord Freyberg, who adored the beach as a young man). However, the beach\u0027s greatest renovation came in 2004, when 22,000 tonnes of sand was shipped especially from Golden Bay to rebuild the beach, which had become worn down over many years.In the summer months, Oriental Bay becomes a hive of activity. The beach seems covered with swimmers, party goers and families. The Carter Fountain is a distinctive feature in the Bay, as is the wooden barge which is often covered in swimmers. A small section of the bay that lies beside Freyberg pool is known as Freyberg Bay, after Lord Freyberg.\r\n"},{"docId":1258,"docName":"Oriental Beat.txt","content":"Oriental Beat is the second studio album by the Finnish glam punk band Hanoi Rocks, recorded in London and released in 1982.

His novels, mostly ultraobjective, deadpan accounts of characters in extreme states of mind, include The Goalie\u0027s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick (1970) and The Left-Handed Woman (1976).

Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful nonviolent campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as a type of protest called civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of protest permits), economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. One state reaction to protests is the use of riot police. Observers have noted an increased militarization of protest policing in many countries, with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against protesters. When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open civil disobedience, more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration.\r\nA protest itself may at times be the subject of a counter-protest. In such cases, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest. Protesters and counter-protesters can sometimes violently clash. One study found that non-violent activism during the civil rights movement in the United States tended to produce favorable media coverage and changes in public opinion focusing on the issues organizers were raising, but violent protests tended to generate unfavorable media coverage that generated public desire to restore law and order.\r\n"},{"docId":1371,"docName":"Proving a negative.txt","content":"Proving a negative or negative proof may refer to:\r\n\r\nProving a negative, in the philosophic burden of proof\r\nEvidence of absence in general, such as evidence that there is no milk in a certain bowl\r\nModus tollens, a logical proof\r\nProof of impossibility, mathematics\r\nRussell\u0027s teapot, an analogy: inability to disprove does not prove\r\nSometimes it is mistaken for an argument from ignorance, which is non-proof and a logical fallacy\r\n"},{"docId":1372,"docName":"Pseudonocardia tropica.txt","content":"Pseudonocardia tropica is a bacterium from the genus of Pseudonocardia which has been isolated from the stem of the tree Maytenus austroyunnanensis in Xishuangbanna in China.\r\n"},{"docId":1373,"docName":"Pseudotothyris obtusa.txt","content":"Pseudotothyris obtusa is a species of armored catfish endemic to Brazil.

In simple terms, the method is the trial and error technique of using test (\"false\") values for the variable and then adjusting the test value according to the outcome. This is sometimes also referred to as \"guess and check\". Versions of the method predate the advent of algebra and the use of equations.\r\nAs an example, consider problem 26 in the Rhind papyrus, which asks for a solution of (written in modern notation) the equation x + x/4 \u003d 15. This is solved by false position. First, guess that x \u003d 4 to obtain, on the left, 4 + 4/4 \u003d 5. This guess is a good choice since it produces an integer value. However, 4 is not the solution of the original equation, as it gives a value which is three times too small. To compensate, multiply x (currently set to 4) by 3 and substitute again to get 12 + 12/4 \u003d 15, verifying that the solution is x \u003d 12.\r\nModern versions of the technique employ systematic ways of choosing new test values and are concerned with the questions of whether or not an approximation to a solution can be obtained, and if it can, how fast can the approximation be found.\r\n"},{"docId":1388,"docName":"Regula Zürcher.txt","content":"Regula Martha Zürcher (née Scalabrin; born 5 January 1969) is retired Swiss athlete who competed primarily in the 400 metres and 800 metres.

This may also be misleading if taken out of context: the center of gravity may be lowered, e.g., by bends and sways. In addition, a certain amount of body rise and fall may be achieved by hip action, used in Latin dance, but absolutely proscribed in Standard and Smooth.\r\nRises and falls of the body is a natural phenomenon during casual walking: when feet are apart the body is closer to the ground than when the feet are together.

A beam of light is split and the two beams are made to follow the same path but in opposite directions. On return to the point of entry the two light beams are allowed to exit the ring and undergo interference. The relative phases of the two exiting beams, and thus the position of the interference fringes, are shifted according to the angular velocity of the apparatus. In other words, when the interferometer is at rest with respect to a nonrotating frame, the light takes the same amount of time to traverse the ring in either direction. However, when the interferometer system is spun, one beam of light has a longer path to travel than the other in order to complete one circuit of the mechanical frame, and so takes longer, resulting in a phase difference between the two beams. Georges Sagnac set up this experiment in an attempt to prove the existence of the aether that Einstein\u0027s theory of special relativity had discarded.A gimbal mounted mechanical gyroscope remains pointing in the same direction after spinning up, and thus can be used as a rotational reference for an inertial navigation system. With the development of so-called laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes based on the Sagnac effect, bulky mechanical gyroscopes can be replaced by those with no moving parts in many modern inertial navigation systems. A conventional gyroscope relies on the principle of conservation of angular momentum whereas the sensitivity of the ring interferometer to rotation arises from the invariance of the speed of light for all inertial frames of reference.\r\n"},{"docId":1515,"docName":"Saifullah Yusuf.txt","content":"H.

The protein plays a role in pre-mRNA processing, possibly tissue-specific alternative splicing events. Although individual snRNPs are believed to recognize specific nucleic acid sequences through RNA-RNA base pairing, the specific role of this family member is unknown. The protein arises from a bicistronic transcript that also encodes a protein identified as the SNRPN upstream reading frame (SNURF). Multiple transcription initiation sites have been identified and extensive alternative splicing occurs in the 5\u0027 untranslated region. Additional splice variants have been described but sequences for the complete transcripts have not been determined. The 5\u0027 UTR of this gene has been identified as an imprinting center. Alternative splicing or deletion caused by a translocation event in this paternally-expressed region is responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome due to parental imprint switch failure.SNRPN-methylation is used to detect uniparental disomy of chromosome 15.  After fluorescent-in-situ-hybridization has confirmed the presence of either SNRPN or UBE3A (a neighboring gene that is also imprinted), the methylation test (of SNRPN) can reveal whether the patient has uniparental disomy.  SNRPN is maternally methylated (silenced). UBE3A appears to be paternally methylated (silenced).\r\n"},{"docId":1584,"docName":"Smuggling of firearms into Mexico.txt","content":"Mexicans have a right to own firearms, but legal purchase from the single Mexican gun shop in Mexico City, controlled by the Army, is extremely difficult. Guns smuggled into Mexico are sometimes obtained at gunshops in the United States and carried across the US-Mexico border. In other cases the guns are obtained through Guatemalan borders or stolen from the police or military.  Consequently, black market firearms are widely available. Many firearms are acquired in the U.S. by women with no criminal history, who transfer their purchases to smugglers through relatives, boyfriends and acquaintances who then smuggle them to Mexico a few at a time. The most common smuggled firearms include AR-15 and AK-47 type rifles, and FN 5.7 caliber semi-automatic pistols. Many firearms are purchased in the United States in a semi-automatic configuration before being converted to fire as select fire machine guns.  Mexico seized in 2009 a combined total of more than 4,400 firearms of the AK-47 and AR-15 type, and 30% of AK-47 type semi-automatic rifles seized have been modified as  select fire weapons.There are multiple reports of grenade launchers being used against security forces, and at least twelve M4 Carbines with M203 grenade launchers have been confiscated. It was believed that some of these high powered weapons and related accessories may have been stolen from U.S. military bases. However, while many U.S. military grade weapons such as grenades and light anti-tank rockets are acquired by the cartels through the huge supply of arms left over from the wars in Central America and Asia, a report from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) found combination weapons that were counterfeits whose specific courses could not be identified. It has been reported that there have been 150,000 desertions from the Mexican army during 2003 to 2009. Stated another way, about one-eighth of the Mexican army deserts annually. Many of these deserters take their government-issued automatic rifles with them while leaving. Some of those weapons originate from the USA.  It has been determined that at least some of the M203 grenade launchers and M16A2 assault rifles cited above are of counterfeit origin manufactured for the cartels, possibly to resemble the weapons carried by the Mexican Special Forces.\r\n"},{"docId":1585,"docName":"Solar art prize.txt","content":"The Solar art prize is an annual art exhibition hosted by the Royal Society of the Arts, South Australia.

The SUCRE was intended to replace the US dollar as a medium of exchange in order to decrease US influence and control of Latin American economies and to increase stability of regional markets.\r\n\r\nThe SUCRE was first used as a virtual currency in 2010 in two transactions between Ecuador and Venezuela. International trade between member states in SUCRE reached its maximum in 2012 with 2,646 transactions worth almost 1,066 million US dollars. In each following year trade in SUCRE shrank. In 2015 there were 752 transactions worth around 345 million dollars.The plan for the introduction of the SUCRE, initially as a virtual currency, paralleled the European Union\u0027s introduction of the euro in 1999, which was preceded by the European Currency Unit in 1979. The SUCRE was intended as the unit of account for all transactions in a clearinghouse. Its value derived from a basket of currencies from the member countries, weighted according to the relative size of the economies.The treaty explicitly limited the backing assets of the basket of currencies to financial securities denominated in the respective currencies of the member states. Prohibition of alternative forms of currency backing (such as commodity backing) presented an inequity for Ecuador that, alone in the group, does not have its own national currency (it uses the US dollar).In the case of ALBA members Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda, the new currency posed a dilemma as they are already a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union and use the East Caribbean dollar, although none of them had agreed to the treaty establishing the SUCRE and the regional payments clearinghouse.The SUCRE is named after Antonio José de Sucre, a leading figure in Latin America\u0027s independence struggle. Agreement in general terms for the currency was declared in 2009. The formal treaty establishing the regional payments clearinghouse was signed by the six Latin American presidents in Cochabamba, Bolivia, on October 17, 2009. (The former currency of Ecuador, one of the SUCRE\u0027s users, was also called the sucre, but was abandoned and replaced by the US dollar after the economic crisis in 1999).\r\nThis currency has code XSU in ISO 4217 standard currency list.In 2013 Uruguay joined the currency.In 2018, the government of Venezuela proposed using the Petro, instead, for trade within ALBA.\r\n"},{"docId":1629,"docName":"SUD Salon Urbain de Douala.txt","content":"The SUD Salon Urbain de Douala (meaning South - Urban Festival of Douala) is a triennial festival of public art and contemporary art organised in Douala, Cameroon.

They were banned in the UK around 1910, and are now illegal everywhere, the last vestiges being seen in New Zealand.\r\nThe key features were:\r\n\r\nterminating deposits were open to subscription by depositors for a period of time until the required number of depositors to make it viable had been found. Then the Group as it was known would be closed off and subsequent applicants would be enrolled into the next group.\r\ndepositors were contracted to make a small deposit on a regular basis e.g. weekly or monthly (similar to insurance savings policies)\r\nno interest was received on these deposits\r\nwhenever the group had enough funds a ballot would be held of all depositors who were up to date with payments. The ballot prize was an interest free mortgage loan for around 60% of the value of a house (in line with the local rules for trustee investments).Characteristically the groups had a lifespan of 20–25 years and no ballots would be held in the first 10 years while funds built up. By the time ballots started after 10 years, ballot winners would normally have enough funds saved to cover the 40% contribution to buy a house with the other 60% coming from the interest free mortgage.\r\nAs originally established some depositors would never receive a mortgage (win a ballot) i.e. the number of ballots over the life of the scheme was less than the number of depositors.\r\nSo why would anyone join a scheme where you might make deposits for 20–25 years and never receive interest on them and simply get the amount you had saved back at the end of the period? The answer goes back to the conditions of the working class at the time they were devised and the working class self-help movement which also gave rise to trade unions, the co-operative movement etc. The time is the late 18th century when the building society movement was starting. Working-class people did not have access to the banking system and critically nor did their self-help enterprises. Accordingly, the terminating deposit product had to be designed in such a way that it did not depend in any way on the wider financial markets and in particular it did not involve any borrowing by the building society which promoted it. It had to be totally self-funding at every stage of its life cycle. In its original format ballots were only held when there was sufficient money in the kitty to provide an interest free mortgage to the winner. If there weren\u0027t enough funds there was no ballot and this ability to turn off the balloting tap made the product very resilient. The groups were able to survive prolonged economic depressions by simply not holding any ballots until things got better.\r\nWhilst working-class families aspired to own their own home, they didn\u0027t have access to the banking system, and they could not realistically expect to save enough in their working life to buy one. Accordingly, they were willing to enter terminating deposit schemes which did not guarantee them a house in exchange for their savings but were a mechanism by which some members of the scheme would get one, through the chance element of the ballot.\r\n"},{"docId":1698,"docName":"Terrell on the Law of Patents.txt","content":"Terrell on the Law of Patents is a United Kingdom patent law treatise of the twentieth century.\r\n"},{"docId":1699,"docName":"Texan brig Wharton.txt","content":"The Texan brig Wharton was a two-masted brig of the Second Texas Navy from 1839-1846.

It consists of a wooden body shaped like an hourglass, and it is taut, with two drum heads with cords that can be squeezed or released to increase or decrease the tension of the heads respectively. This mechanism allows the player to raise or lower the pitch of the drum while playing, not unlike the African talking drum and the Indian Dhadd.\r\nThere are two basic techniques when playing a tsuzumi; holding the cords slack and hitting the drumhead on the very center, or squeezing the cords and hitting the drumhead closer to where it meets the wooden body. The former produces softer pon and pu sounds, whereas the latter produces higher-pitched ta and chi sounds. Because the practice of hitting a drumhead on the very center may result in hindering the sound by causing vibration radiating on two opposite sides of the drumhead to cancel out with each other, the tsuzumi is tuned with tiny leather patches applied on the inside of the heads, much like the larger shime-daiko that accompany the tsuzumi in Noh and Kabuki theaters. It is also notable that the tsuzumi, being a more delicate instrument compared to the shime-daiko, is further fine-tuned on-site depending on ambient temperature and humidity using pieces of washi paper moistened with the player\u0027s own saliva.\r\nCare for this instrument is peculiar in that the drum heads must be exposed to a certain level of moisture to produce a desirable sound. Before playing the tsuzumi, the player will breathe directly onto both heads. Sometimes he will even take some saliva and apply it to the head of the drum. The quality of sound of the drum will depend on how much moisture is in the atmosphere where it is being played. To make sure the drum heads are moist, the player will breathe into the drum head at intervals when he is not playing. However, if the heads become excessively moist, they may become too slack to be played properly, and may develop noticeable ripples on the surface, further compromising the sound quality.\r\nEach drumhead is crafted with a piece of foal skin sewn onto an iron ring. Then a thick layer of reinforcement is added on the back, and finished with urushi lacquer and gold leaves. The sew marks are also covered up with urushi lacquer, which provides both decoration and further reinforcement to the drumhead. In contrast, the drumheads used for the ōtsuzumi are made of thick horsehide, and are never decorated, as they are meant to be consumables. The wooden body is carved out from a single block of cherry wood, and is decorated with urushi lacquer and gold leaves in the maki-e style.

This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, as a consequence of an incorrect and naive application of time dilation and the principle of relativity, each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less. However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin\u0027s trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey. Another way of looking at it is to realize the travelling twin is undergoing acceleration, which makes him a non-inertial observer. In both views there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. Therefore, the twin paradox is not actually a paradox in the sense of a logical contradiction.\r\nStarting with Paul Langevin in 1911, there have been various explanations of this paradox. These explanations \"can be grouped into those that focus on the effect of different standards of simultaneity in different frames, and those that designate the acceleration [experienced by the travelling twin] as the main reason\". Max von Laue argued in 1913 that since the traveling twin must be in two separate inertial frames, one on the way out and another on the way back, this frame switch is the reason for the aging difference. Explanations put forth by Albert Einstein and Max Born invoked gravitational time dilation to explain the aging as a direct effect of acceleration. However, it has been proven that neither general relativity, nor even acceleration, are necessary to explain the effect, as the effect still applies if two astronauts pass each other at the turnaround point and synchronize their clocks at that point. Such observer can be thought of as a pair of observers, one travelling away from the starting point and another travelling toward it, passing by each other where the turnaround point would be. At this moment, the clock reading in the first observer is transferred to the second one, both maintaining constant speed, with both trip times being added at the end of their journey.\r\n"},{"docId":1786,"docName":"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow.txt","content":"\"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow\" is the eighth episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series South Park.

There is a wide variety of different theories and approaches to the study of urbanism. However, in some contexts internationally, urbanism is synonymous with urban planning, and urbanist refers to an urban planner.\r\nThe term urbanism originated in the late nineteenth century with the Spanish engineer-architect Ildefons Cerda, whose intent was to create an autonomous activity focused on the spatial organization of the city. Urbanism\u0027s emergence in the early 20th century was associated with the rise of centralized manufacturing, mixed-use neighborhoods, social organizations and networks, and what has been described as \"the convergence between political, social and economic citizenship\".Urbanism can be understood as placemaking and the creation of place identity at a citywide level, however as early as 1938 Louis Wirth wrote that it is necessary to stop \u0027identify[ing] urbanism with the physical entity of the city\u0027, go \u0027beyond an arbitrary boundary line\u0027 and consider how \u0027technological developments in transportation and communication have enormously extended the urban mode of living beyond the confines of the city itself.\u0027\r\n"},{"docId":1796,"docName":"Uritsky District.txt","content":"Uritsky District (Russian: Урицкий райо́н) is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the twenty-four in Oryol Oblast, Russia.

Web GIS emphasizes geodata processing aspects more involved with design aspects such as data acquisition and server software architecture such as data storage and algorithms, than it does the end-user reports themselves.The terms web GIS and web mapping remain somewhat synonymous. Web GIS uses web maps, and end users who are web mapping are gaining analytical capabilities. The term location-based services refers to web mapping consumer goods and services.  Web mapping usually involves a web browser or other user agent capable of client-server interactions.  Questions of quality, usability, social benefits, and legal constraints are driving its evolution.The advent of web mapping can be regarded as a major new trend in cartography. Until recently cartography was restricted to a few companies, institutes and mapping agencies, requiring relatively expensive and complex hardware and software as well as skilled cartographers and geomatics engineers.\r\nWeb mapping has brought many geographical datasets, including free ones generated by OpenStreetMap and proprietary datasets owned by HERE, Google, Tencent, TomTom, and others.

Web projects are based on TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) technology and concern the transfer of static and dynamic content.\r\nA Web project involves many aspects, including programming and the accompanying software development, Web business, Web server and network administration, hosting, graphics/design, the development and administration of databases, construction of interfaces, project management and quality assurance, search engine optimization, the maintenance of data in content management/editing systems and much more.\r\nProgramming for a web project may be accomplished using one or more markup languages (such as HTML or XML), scripting languages (JavaScript, Perl, PHP for example) or even more complex programming languages (such as C/C++/C# or Java).\r\nWhen hosting a Web project, the primary objectives include the provision of the necessary hardware and software infrastructure, and an assurance that the highest possible levels of availability and reliability are offered.\r\nGraphic/Web design for Web projects must offer a high quality of use for persons interacting with the website.\r\nAgile project management methods (e.g. Scrum) are used for the management of modern Web projects in order to respond to changes in customer requirements and constraints as the project progresses. The project manager is responsible for the efficient and result-oriented programming of the Web project.\r\n"},{"docId":1890,"docName":"Web property.txt","content":"A web property is a point of presence (e.g. a website, social media account, blog, etc.) on the web that is an asset of an entity (e.g. an individual or corporation) used for the purpose of representing a brand, person or other identity. The property can be considered a communication channel for the entity whose identity is associated with it. Points of presence on the web which contain content about an entity may not be property that can be owned by that entity (e.g. restaurant review pages on sites such as Yelp).\r\nWeb property is considered intangible property and is analogous to real property in that it has ownership which can be recorded and transferred though ascertaining ownership is not always a simple or easy matter to resolve. The issue of ownership can be particularly challenging in relation to the employer-employee situation. Two current legal cases are likely to set precedent in this area, § PhoneDog v. Kravitz and § Eagle v. Morgan.\r\n\r\n"},{"docId":1891,"docName":"Web query classification.txt","content":"A Web query topic classification/categorization is a problem in information science. The task is to assign a Web search query to one or more predefined categories, based on its topics. The importance of query classification is underscored by many services provided by Web search. A direct application is to provide better search result pages for users with interests of different categories. For example, the users issuing a Web query \"apple\" might expect to see Web pages related to the fruit apple, or they may prefer to see products or news related to the computer company. Online advertisement services can rely on the query classification results to promote different products more accurately. Search result pages can be grouped according to the categories predicted by a query classification algorithm. However, the computation of query classification is non-trivial. Different from the document classification tasks, queries submitted by Web search users are usually short and ambiguous; also the meanings of the queries are evolving over time. Therefore, query topic classification is much more difficult than traditional document classification tasks.\r\n\r\n"},{"docId":1892,"docName":"Web ranking.txt","content":"Web ranking may refer to:\r\n\r\nAlexa web ranking system\r\nCompete.com, web ranking analysis based on United States traffic\r\nGoogle PageRank, link analysis algorithm\r\nWebometrics Ranking of World Universities, Ranking Web of World Universities\r\n"},{"docId":1893,"docName":"Web resource.txt","content":"A web resource is any identifiable resource (digital, physical, or abstract) present on or connected to the World Wide Web.

A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.\r\nA resource sent from a web server can be a preexisting file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications.\r\nTechnologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.\r\n"},{"docId":1898,"docName":"Web service.txt","content":"The term Web service (WS) is either:\r\n\r\na service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or\r\na server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images).In a Web service a Web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.\r\nIn practice, a web service commonly provides an object-oriented Web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another Web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end-user.

Combat is governed by a version of the turn-based \"Active Time Battle\" system. The story follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey across the world to overthrow the all-powerful rule of Solaris and uncover mysteries concerning their world. The story incorporates Jungian psychology, Freudian thought, and religious symbolism.\r\nCreated by Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Kaori Tanaka as a proposal for Final Fantasy VII, it was allowed to be developed as its own project; first as a sequel to Chrono Trigger and then as an original game with a science fiction premise. It was developed under the working title \"Project Noah\". The characters were designed by Kunihiko Tanaka, while the gears were designed by Junya Ishigaki and Yoshinori Ogura. The designs were portrayed during in-game cinematics through the use of anime cutscenes. Due to time constraints and the team\u0027s general inexperience, the second half of the game\u0027s plot was primarily told through cutscenes.\r\nThe game was almost not localized due to its religious content; its localization was handled by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described it as one of the most troublesome games of his career.

Praises particularly went towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and psychological and religious themes, but received criticism for the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration.
