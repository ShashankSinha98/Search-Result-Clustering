The Orient is a term for the East, traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the Eastern world, in relation to Europe. It is the antonym of Occident, the Western World. In English, it is largely a metonym for, and coterminous with, the continent of Asia, loosely classified into the Near East, Middle East and Far East: the geographical and ethno-cultural regions now known as West Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Originally, the term Orient was used to designate the Near East, and later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also the Middle East or the Far East.  
The term oriental is often used to describe objects from the Orient, however it can be considered an offensive term by some when used to refer to people of East Asian and South East Asian descent. It can also refer to the inhabitants of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, the term oriental refers to the geographic location of the country, east of the Uruguay River.
