Captain Marvel Jr., also known as Shazam Jr. (Frederick "Freddy" Freeman), is a fictional superhero originally published by Fawcett Comics and currently published by DC Comics. A member of the Marvel/Shazam Family team of superheroes associated with Captain Marvel/Shazam, he was created by Ed Herron and Mac Raboy, and first appeared in Whiz Comics #25 in December 1941.
In the original Fawcett and DC continuity, Captain Marvel Jr.'s alter-ego was Freddy Freeman, a disabled newsboy saved by Captain Marvel from the villainous Captain Nazi. To save the dying boy's life, Captain Marvel shares his powers with Freddy. By saying the name "Captain Marvel", Freddy is transformed into Captain Marvel Jr., a blue costumed version of himself possessing powers of superhuman strength, speed, wisdom, and more. Junior derived his powers from Captain Marvel himself, while the other Marvels derived their powers from the wizard Shazam. Unlike Captain Marvel and the modern-era version of Mary Marvel, Junior remained a teenager in his transformed state.A Trials of Shazam! maxi-series published from 2006 to 2008 featured Freddy Freeman undergoing six trials to prove himself worthy of succeeding Captain Marvel, who takes over the wizard Shazam's post on the Rock of Eternity. Upon completion of the Trials, Freddy assumed the superhero name Shazam. Following DC's New 52 reboot in 2011, Freddy Freeman – now a blond instead of the traditional dark-haired youth – appears in current DC Comics publications as one of Billy Batson's foster siblings, and at Billy's whim can share the Shazam powers and become an adult superhero.
Freddy Freeman made his cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film Shazam!, portrayed by Jack Dylan Grazer and Adam Brody as a teenager and adult respectively. Grazer and Brody are set to return for a sequel film, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, in 2023.
