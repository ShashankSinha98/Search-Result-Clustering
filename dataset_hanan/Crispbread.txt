Crispbread (Swedish: knäckebröd (lit. crack bread), hårt bröd (hard bread), hårdbröd, spisbröd (stove bread), knäcke, Danish: knækbrød, Norwegian: knekkebrød, Finnish: näkkileipä, Estonian: näkileib, Icelandic: hrökkbrauð, Faroese: knekkbreyð, German: 'Knäckebrot' or 'Knäcke', Low German: Knackbrood, Dutch: knakbrood) is a flat and dry type of cracker, containing mostly rye flour. Crispbreads are lightweight and keep fresh for a very long time due to their lack of water. Crispbread is a staple food and was for a long time considered a poor man's diet. However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in crispbread in the Nordic countries.
