Saddle Peak is a set of twin peaks with a distinct saddle between them, located five kilometres (three miles) northwest of Mount Kostka in western Anare Mountains. It was given this descriptive name by ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) (Thala Dan), which explored this area, in 1962.
