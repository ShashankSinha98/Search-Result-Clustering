The Rishengchang Piaohao (simplified Chinese: 日升昌票号; traditional Chinese: 日升昌票號; pinyin: Rì shēng chāng piào hào), was the first draft bank in China. It is located in Pingyao, Shanxi province, China. Rishengchang literally translates to 'Sunrise Prosperity', and piaohao means 'draft banks', predecessors of modern banks in China. It was estimated to be founded during the Qing Dynasty in 1823. In the nineteenth century, at its peak, it controlled almost half of the Chinese economy and its branches were widespread throughout major cities in China, and also in some foreign countries, including Russia, Mongolia, and Japan.
The draft bank is now a museum and in 2006 was included on the List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (6-484).
