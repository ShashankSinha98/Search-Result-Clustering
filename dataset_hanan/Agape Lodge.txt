The Agape Lodge was a California-based chapter of the Ordo Templi Orientis founded in 1935 by Wilfred Talbot Smith. Following World War II, it was the sole surviving O.T.O. organization.In 1942, jet fuel engineer Jack Parsons was appointed head of the lodge, and the organization was headquartered out of Parson's mansion in Pasadena.   In 1946, Parsons lost a great deal of money in a business venture with L. Ron Hubbard and Sarah Northrup, resulting in him selling the mansion.  In 1949, the Agape Lodge ceased to hold regular meetings.
