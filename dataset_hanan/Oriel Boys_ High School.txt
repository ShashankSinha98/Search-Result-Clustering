Oriel Boys' High School is a school located in Harare, Zimbabwe. It has been used as a polling station for both local elections in 2010 and national elections five years later. The school is perhaps best known for having played and lost a football match in which the school-boy team was defeating by an opposing team which consisted of much older players; in one case an opposing team's player was thirty-four years old.
