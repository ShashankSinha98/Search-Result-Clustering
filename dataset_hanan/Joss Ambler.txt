Joss Ambler (23 June 1900 â€“ 1959) was an Australian-born British film and television actor. He usually played somewhat pompous and irascible figures of authority, particularly in comedy films. He was an effective foil to George Formby in both Trouble Brewing (as Lord Redhill) and Come On George! (as Sir Charles), and similarly to Will Hay in The Black Sheep of Whitehall, (as a government minister).
