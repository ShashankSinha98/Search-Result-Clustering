# Search Result Clustering

## What is Clustering?
- Clustering is the process of dividing the entire data into groups (also known as clusters) based on the patterns in the data.

- In clustering, we do not have a target to predict. We look at the data, try to club similar observations, and form different groups. Hence it is an unsupervised learning problem.

## Document Clustering

- This is common application of clustering. Letâ€™s say you have multiple documents and you need to cluster similar documents together. Clustering helps us group these documents such that similar documents are in the same clusters.
