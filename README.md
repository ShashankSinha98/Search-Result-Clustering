## Introduction
The "Search Result Clustering" project implements a clustering algorithm to group data points based on similarity. This unsupervised machine-learning technique is applied to document clustering, a common task in data analysis and machine learning.

## Project Overview
The goal is to create a visualization of clustered search results, showcasing the relationships and similarities between different results. It's applicable in scenarios requiring insights into document connections.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Lucene (for Pre-processing), Django (Backend), React JS (Frontend), Python's Sklearn library (Machine Learning)
- **Algorithms**: K-Means

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python
- Java
- Django
- React JS
- Sklearn

### Steps
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ShashankSinha98/Search-Result-Clustering
2. Install Python and Java.
3. Install Django for backend development and React JS for frontend development.
4. Install Sklearn for machine learning tasks.
5. Create a `requirements.txt` file and use it to install Python dependencies.

## Usage
1. Start the application:
2. Navigate to the `Text-Clustering` folder, find `textclusteringdjango` and `textclusteringreact` folders to set up servers.
3. Use the interface to input queries and specify the number of clusters.
4. View the results which include a visual representation of the clusters and detailed information in a separate window.
