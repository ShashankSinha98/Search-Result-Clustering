Jaroslav Kubera (16 February 1947 â€“ 20 January 2020) was a Czech politician for the Civic Democratic Party, who served in the Czech Senate representing Teplice from 2000 and the Senate President from 2018 until his death in 2020. He previously served as mayor of Teplice from 1994 to 2018.
Kubera was a potential candidate in the 2018 presidential election, gathering enough support from fellow senators to register his candidacy, before deciding not to run.
He died on 20 January 2020 after suffering a heart attack, becoming the first high-ranking Czech official to die in office.
