The Strange Adventures of Prince Courageous, also known as The Adventures of Prince Courageous, is a 1923 American silent fantasy film series starring Bessie Love and five-year-old Arthur Trimble, directed by Frederick G. Becker.
Although it was planned to be a series of 12 two-reelers, only three films were made: The Little Knight, The Love Charm, and The Crown of Courage (also referred to as The Crown and Courage). A fourth film, The Little Defender, is documented in publications from as early as the 1930s, but is most likely an alternate title for The Love Charm or The Crown of Courage.
The Little Knight is preserved at the Harvard Film Archive, and The Little Defender is rare, but commercially available. The preservation status of the others is unknown.
