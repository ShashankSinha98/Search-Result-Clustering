Notodden Blues Festival (NBF) is one of the largest blues music festivals in Europe and the largest in Scandinavia. The festival is held in Notodden, Norway, usually in early August. It has been running annually since 1988.
The festival does not aim to be the biggest of its type, but to become Europe's "largest blues experience", which is reflected in their emphasis on quality over quantity.
