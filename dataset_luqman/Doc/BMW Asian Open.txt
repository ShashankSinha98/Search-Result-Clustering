The BMW Asian Open was a men's professional golf tournament that was co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and the European Tour. The event was founded in 2001, as part of the European Tour's drive to expand into Asia, and China in particular.
The first two editions were held at Ta Shee Golf and Country Club in Taiwan, before the tournament was moved to the People's Republic of China in 2004, since when it was played at the Tomson Shanghai Pudong Golf Club in Pudong, Shanghai.
In 2005 Ernie Els set a new Asian Tour record for the biggest margin of victory when he triumphed by 13 strokes. In 2008 the prize fund was $2.3 million, an increase of more than fifty percent from the 2006 fund of $1.5 million.
