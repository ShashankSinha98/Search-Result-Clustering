He holds degrees from the University of Notre Dame and The Ohio State University, having earned both a master's (1970) and a doctorate in sociology (1974) from The Ohio State University with a special emphasis in criminology.

For the last 16 of those years, he chaired the university's Department of Sociology, Social Work, and Criminal Justice. The university named him Distinguished Professor in 1991.
Schmalleger is the author of numerous articles and more than 40 books, including the widely used Criminal Justice Today (Pearson, 2019), Criminology Today (Pearson, 2021), Criminal Law Today (Pearson, 2022); and Corrections in the 21st Century (with John Smykla; McGraw-Hill, 2020).
Schmalleger has taught in the online graduate program of the New School for Social Research, helping build the world's first electronic classrooms in support of distance learning on the Internet. As an adjunct professor with Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, Schmalleger helped develop the university's graduate program in security administration and loss prevention. He taught courses in that curriculum for more than a decade. An avid Web user and website builder, Schmalleger is also the creator of a number of websites, including the Criminal Justice Cybrary (no longer operating), and the Criminal Justice Distance Learning Consortium. The Cybrary was purchased by Pearson Publishing in 2006.
