Hilaalee dynasty was one of the earlier Muslim (later christian) ruling-dynasties of the history of the Maldives. It ruled the country from 1388 to 1573. It came under Portuguese power in 1558 and disestablished in 1573 after the Utheemu rebellion against the Portuguese presence. After the disestablishment, an interregnum period started in the history of the Maldives.
