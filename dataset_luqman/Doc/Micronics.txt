Micronics (マイクロニクス Maikuronikusu) was a Japanese video game developer in 1980s and 1990s. It mostly ported arcade games to the Nintendo Entertainment System. Like many video game developers, Micronics didn't credit itself in its games, displaying instead only the name of the video game publisher (with exception of Super Volleyball for the Sega Mega Drive).
While the company is not well known in the game industry, it has produced some obscure titles like 89 Dennou Kyusei Uranai.  Kazuo (Kazzo) Yagi was the main programmer for the games during the NES era. The company hired professional musicians to compose music for its games such as Tsugutoshi Goto, Kimio Nomura, and Joe Hisaishi.
The company started to develop SNES games, again uncredited. However, some of its games credited Khaos in the ROM, which is believed to have been Micronics's name while developing SNES games.
