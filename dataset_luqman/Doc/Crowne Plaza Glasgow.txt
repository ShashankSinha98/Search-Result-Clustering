Crowne Plaza Glasgow is a high-rise hotel in the Finnieston area of Glasgow, Scotland.  Originally opened in 1989, it is a 4-star property on the banks of the River Clyde adjacent to the SEC Centre, the SEC Armadillo and the OVO Hydro. The building (along with the adjacent SEC Campus buildings), is frequently used as one of the most recognisable images of the modern Clydeside.
