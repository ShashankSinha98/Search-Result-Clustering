Atlantic Rhapsody is a 1989 Faroese documentary film by Katrin Ottarsdóttir. The original Faroese title is Atlantic Rhapsody - 52 myndir úr Tórshavn, where the second part means "52 pictures from Tórshavn". The film presents a day in the life of some inhabitants of Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands. The narrative is structured as a relay race, in which a person, a thing or something out of a scene brings the audience into another scene with new people and events. It is the first ever Faroese feature-length film.
