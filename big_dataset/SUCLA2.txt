Succinyl-CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial (SUCLA2), also known as  ADP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-A), is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the SUCLA2 gene on chromosome 13.Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that acts as a heterodimer, being composed of an invariant alpha subunit and a substrate-specific beta subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-specific SCS beta subunit that dimerizes with the SCS alpha subunit to form SCS-A, an essential component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. SCS-A hydrolyzes ATP to convert  succinyl-CoA to succinate. Defects in this gene are a cause of myopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. A pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 6. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
