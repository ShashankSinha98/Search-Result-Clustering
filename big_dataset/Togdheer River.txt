The Togdheer River (Somali: Webiga Togdheer) is a seasonal river in the Togdheer region of northeastern Somaliland. The region is named after the river. The river's name comes from "Tog" (which means "riverbed" in the Somali language) and "dheer" (Somali for "long").
The Togdheer River rises in the foothills of the Golis Mountains, specifically the upper slope of the Ga'an Libah reserve, flows south through the city of Burao, where it splits the city in half, and then vanishes into the eastern plains of the Togdheer region and the northern part of Sool, where it provides winter sustenance to the arid Nugaal valley. The riverbed is usually dry, but is subject to flooding when heavy rains fall in the mountains.
