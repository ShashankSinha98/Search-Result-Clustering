Alfred Dubucand (25 November 1828 â€“ 1894) was a French animalier sculptor who worked in the mid-to-late 19th century. His works were often juried into the annual Salon art exhibition in Paris where he contributed works over the course of his career. Dubucand made his debut at the 1867 Salon with a wax model of a dead pheasant.
