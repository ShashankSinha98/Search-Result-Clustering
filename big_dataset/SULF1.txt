Sulfatase 1, also known as SULF1, is an enzyme which in humans is encoded by the SULF1 gene.Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as co-receptors for numerous heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling. Heparan sulfate 6-O-endo-sulfatases, such as SULF1, selectively remove 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate. This activity modulates the effects of heparan sulfate by altering binding sites for signaling molecules.
