Drinking Gasoline is a 1985 EP release (taking the form of two 12" singles) by Cabaret Voltaire, originally released on the Some Bizzare label and distributed through Virgin Records. All four tracks are featured on the band's "Gasoline in Your Eye" videocassette, also issued in 1985. All known copies of the original UK pressing had labels on the wrong discs (ie, side 1 label on side 3, side 2 label on side 4.) It peaked at #71 in the UK.
