Woggabaliri is a traditional Indigenous Australian "co-operative kicking volley game".The Aborigines in areas of and near New South Wales played a ball game called Woggabaliri. The ball was usually made of possum fur, and was played in a group of four to six players in circle. It was a co-operative kicking game to see for how long the ball can be kept in the air before it touches the ground.
