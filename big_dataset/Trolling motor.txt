A trolling motor is a self-contained unit that includes an electric motor, propeller and controls, and is affixed to an angler's boat, either at the bow or stern.   A gasoline-powered outboard used in trolling, if it is not the vessel's primary source of propulsion, may also be referred to as a trolling motor.  Trolling motors are often lifted from the water to reduce drag when the boat's primary engine is in operation.
