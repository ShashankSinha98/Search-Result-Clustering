In computer science, SUHA (Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption) is a basic assumption that facilitates the mathematical analysis of hash tables.  The assumption states that a hypothetical hashing function will evenly distribute items into the slots of a hash table.  Moreover, each item to be hashed has an equal probability of being placed into a slot, regardless of the other elements already placed.  This assumption generalizes the details of the hash function and allows for certain assumptions about the stochastic system.
