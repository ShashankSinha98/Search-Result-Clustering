The Pittsburgh Colts are the oldest minor-league professional football team, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that is still in existence. They are currently members of the Gridiron Developmental Football League (GDFL).The team was founded in 1979 by head coach Edward G. Brosky, a member of the Pittsburgh Panthers 1976 national championship team. The Colts initial run lasted from 1979 until 1987, when the team took a four-year hiatus. In 1981, the team advanced to the national championship game located in San Francisco, to play against the Twin City Cougars, who later became the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League. The team also briefly disbanded after the 2000 season due its board of directors and coaching staff have become the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Ironmen, a new professional indoor football team set to begin competing in February 2001.
Brosky also played as a semi-pro football player while playing college football, until then-Panthers coach Johnny Majors found out and ended Brosky's moonlighting. When he left Pitt, Brosky continued to play for semi-pro teams in the area. He started the Colts when those other teams folded. Since 1979, Brosky has either played for or coached the Colts. In 2004 Lisa Horton became the first woman to throw a touchdown pass in a North America Football League game
