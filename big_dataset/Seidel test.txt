The Seidel test is used to assess the presence of aqueous humor leakage from anterior chamber of the eye.  Leakage may occur due to many corneal or scleral disorders, including corneal post-trauma, post-surgical leak, corneal perforation and corneal degeneration. Initially the test was used to detect aqueous humor leakage in postoperative patients, later it expanded to detect other causes or anterior chamber leakage.
