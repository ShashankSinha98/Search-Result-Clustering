The Wiluna uranium mine is a proposed uranium mine in Western Australia. The mine project, owned by Toro Energy Ltd, is located 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of the mining town of Wiluna.  The original proposal was to establish open cut mines at Lake Way and Centipede deposits. In 2013, the Wiluna project became the first uranium mine to receive all necessary approvals in the state of Western Australia since the ban on uranium mining was repealed there in 2008. Federal environmental approval for the mine's development was granted under the EPBC Act in April 2013.
