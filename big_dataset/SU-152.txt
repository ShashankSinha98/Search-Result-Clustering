The SU-152 (Russian: самоходная установка-152, СУ-152, romanized: Samokhodnaya Ustanovka-152) is a Soviet self-propelled heavy howitzer used during World War II.
It mounted a 152 mm gun-howitzer on the chassis of a KV-1S heavy tank.  Later production used an IS tank chassis and was re-designated ISU-152.  Because of its adopted role as an impromptu heavy tank destroyer, capable of knocking out the heaviest German armoured vehicles—Tiger and Panther tanks, and Elefant tank destroyers—it was nicknamed Zveroboy ("Beast Slayer").
