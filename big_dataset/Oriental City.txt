Oriental City was a major shopping centre in Colindale, North London, England, originally built as a luxury Japanese shopping centre called Yaohan Plaza by the Yaohan retail company of Japan. After Yaohan filed for bankruptcy in the late 1990s, the centre became a lower-end mall specialising in various oriental foods and items, while also containing health and social services for the East Asian community. Opening in 1993, the 141,000 sq ft complex was located on Edgware Road with a dedicated car park and two floors.Referred to as London's "real Chinatown", Oriental City received about 10,000 visitors weekly as of 2006. The complex was closed for redevelopment on 1 June 2008 and, after several changes of ownership, was demolished in August 2014. In July 2017 the smaller Bang Bang Oriental Food Hall opened on the site, comprising 32 food kiosks, massage and beauty therapy suites as well as shops and a cultural centre.
