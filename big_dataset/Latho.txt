Latho is a traditional solitaire game played by the Dorz√© people of Ethiopia. The equipment needed to play the game is similar to that used for mancala games, i.e., a board with 2 rows of 6 "pits", and 30 counters ("seeds"). The game was first described by British academic Richard Pankhurst in 1971.
