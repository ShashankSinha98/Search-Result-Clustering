Crissy Moran (born December 22, 1975) is a Christian public speaker who was a former American pornographic actress. She began working in adult entertainment in 1999, and between 2001 and 2006 had performed in over 50 adult films. In 2006, Moran became a devout Christian and quit working in the adult industry. After retirement, she began speaking about her experiences in porn and appearing in national media projects addressing what she considers "the harms of pornography"; associating adult films with human sex trafficking and the exploitation of women and children.
