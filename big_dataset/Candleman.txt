Candleman is a 3D puzzle-platform game developed by Chinese studio Spotlightor Interactive and published by Indienova and Zodiac Interactive. It was created as a prototype for a Ludum Dare game jam. Following positive reception, a full version of the game was released for the Xbox One and was published on February 1, 2017. It was updated later the same year to Candleman: The Complete Journey with a downloadable Lost Light add-on. The game received positive reviews for its graphics, concept, music, and story, with complaints coming from a lack of depth in the story and difficulty.
