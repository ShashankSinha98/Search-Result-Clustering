The Czechoslovak Indoor Athletics Championships (Czech: Halové mistrovství Československa v atletice) was an annual indoor track and field competition organised by the Czechoslovak Athletics Federation, which served as the national championship for the sport in Czechoslovakia. Held over two days in February during the Czechoslovak winter, it was added to the national calendar in 1969 following the creation of a suitable indoor athletics venue in Jablonec nad Nisou. A Czech-only championship was held at the venue a year earlier.The competition served as the winter, indoor counterpart to the main Czechoslovak Athletics Championships, held outdoors in the summer since 1919. The last edition was held in 1992 and after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia it was succeeded by the separate Czech Indoor and Slovak Indoor Athletics Championships.
