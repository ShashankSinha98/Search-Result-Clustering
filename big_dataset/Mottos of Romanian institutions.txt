Romania has no official motto. Between the years 1859 and 1866 there were several mottos placed on the several coats of arms of the country (like Toți în unu – "All in one"). From 1866 (when the prince Carol I became sovereign of Romania) until 1947 (when the Kingdom was abolished by force by the communists), the official motto was the one of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen: Nihil Sine Deo ("Nothing Without God" in Latin). During the communist regime the country had no motto.
