Hunter School is a historic building near Tabor, Iowa, United States.  The one-room schoolhouse was built in 1901.  The school was named for John H. Hunter, a farmer and landowner on whose property the original school was built in 1901.  Its use as a schoolhouse came to an end in 1920 when it was consolidated into the Tabor School District.  The building was used as a township meeting and a polling place until 1990.  Since then it has been maintained as a historical landmark.  The former schoolhouse is a frame structure built on a brick foundation, and consists of a 24-by-26-foot (7.3 by 7.9 m) main block and an 8-foot (2.4 m) square bell tower-entrance.  While the schoolhouse overall follows a basic plan for a one-room schoolhouse, it departs from that plan with the asymmetrically placed corner tower. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.
