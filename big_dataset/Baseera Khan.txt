Baseera Khan is a New York-based artist. They use a variety of mediums in their practice to "visualize patterns and repetitions of exile and kinship shaped by economic, social, and political changes in local and global environments, with special interests in decolonization processes".Their work navigates the political circumstances of their identity as a self-identified queer femme Muslim and "as a feminist, and as a brown Indian-Afghani".
