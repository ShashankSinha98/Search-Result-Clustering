Eat, Sleep, Repeat is the third full-length release and major label debut from Lakeland, Florida's Copeland. It was recorded at Glow in the Dark in Atlanta during June and July 2006. "We always said that we would only consider working with a label that was passionate about our band and our music, and the folks at Columbia are just that," the band said in a blog on its MySpace page. "Nothing drastic will change other than the fact that hopefully a few more ears will get to hear our music."
