The Yorba Linda Water District is a public agency responsible for water supply and quality for residents of the entire city of Yorba Linda, California, approximately one third of Placentia, small portions of Brea and Anaheim, and the two unincorporated county territories that are in and adjacent to Yorba Linda, which are known as spheres of influence due to their occasional subjection to annexation.
