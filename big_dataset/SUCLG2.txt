Succinyl-CoA ligase [GDP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the SUCLG2 gene on chromosome 3.This gene encodes a GTP-specific beta subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase. Succinyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the formation of succinyl-CoA and succinate. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 5 and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]
