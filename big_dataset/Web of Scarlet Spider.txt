Web of Scarlet Spider  is the name of a short-lived comic book series starring the Scarlet Spider. The series was published by Marvel Comics for four issues between November 1995 and February 1996. It was a direct continuation, in terms of creative teams and storylines, of the previous Web of Spider-Man series in the same way that the other three primary Spider-Man series (The Amazing Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, and Spider-Man) were replaced by Amazing Scarlet Spider, Spectacular Scarlet Spider, and Scarlet Spider respectively during this period. While those series each reverted to their original titles after two issues (the quarterly Spider-Man Unlimited was similarly redone for one issue as Scarlet Spider Unlimited), Web remained a Scarlet Spider title for two additional issues before the series was cancelled entirely.
The first two months of Scarlet Spider titles saw a holographic Scarlet Spider imposter destroy the real Spider's reputation. As a result, Ben Reilly (the real Spider) decided to abandon the Scarlet Spider guise in favor of a new Spider-Man costume in Spectacular Scarlet Spider #2. While the new title The Sensational Spider-Man was created to replace Web as the fourth Spider-Man title, Web continued for two more issues, following Joe Wade in a three-part crossover that included New Warriors vol. 1 #67. Wade was an FBI agent who became possessed by nanotechs in Lady Octopus' lab explosion, giving him Scarlet Spider's appearance and powers.
Creators who contributed to the title include writers Tom DeFalco, Todd DeZago, and Evan Skolnick and pencillers Paris Karounos and Tom Morgan.
The first two issues are collected in Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic Book 1. Issues three and four, along with New Warrior #67, were collected in Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic Book 2.
