Orienspterodon is an extinct genus of hyaenodontid creodont that lived in China and Myanmar during the middle Eocene. It was originally assigned to Pterodon in 1975, but was eventually assigned to its own genus in 2007. Although classified as a member of Hyainailouridae by Egi et al., dental characteristics suggest placement in Hyaenodontidae as a close relative of South Asian members of Proviverrinae.
