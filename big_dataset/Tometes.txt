Tometes is a genus of fish in the family Serrasalmidae found in fast-flowing rivers in northern South America. Adults of all seven species in this genus are phytophagous, feeding primarily on aquatic plants in the family Podostemaceae.The genus name Tometes was coined in 1850 by Valenciennes in reference to the incisiform teeth. When the type species of the genus,  T. trilobatus, was described in 1850, it was placed in synonym with Myleus setiger, the type species of the genus Myleus, which is why Tometes and Myleus were considered to be the same genus for a long time. It was just later that the two genera were revalitated and other specimen could be categorized in the genus Tometes.
