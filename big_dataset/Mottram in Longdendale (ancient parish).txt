Mottram in Longdendale was one of the eight ancient parishes of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire, England. Centred on St Michael and All Angels Church it included the townships of Godley, Hattersley, Hollingworth, Matley, Newton, Stayley, Tintwistle and Mottram itself. Under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1886 the townships became civil parishes in their own right.
