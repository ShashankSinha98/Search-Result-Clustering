Metz's  Waltham Manufacturing Company in Waltham, Massachusetts and advertised in 1899 as a "motor cycle", the first use of the term in a published catalog.Orient advertised that the single-person tricycle could be converted to a two-person four wheeled "autogo" in five minutes. A 1900 Orient appeared in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at Guggenheim Museum in New York.
