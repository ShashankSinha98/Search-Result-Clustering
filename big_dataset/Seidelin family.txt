The Seidelin family is a Danish family descending from bailiff and councilman in Helsing√∏r Michel Seidel (died 1616). He was originally from Werder in Pomerania or East Prussia and purchased a house in the city in 1589. Nothing else is known about his background. The name Seidelin was passed on through his daughters who in accordance with German tradition added the suffix -in to their father's name.
