The Bruce Tree was an oak tree that stood on the grounds of Strathleven House in Dunbartonshire, Scotland.  It is reputed to have been planted by Robert the Bruce and was between 700 and 1,000 years old when it fell from an arson attack in May 2004.  The timber from the tree was saved and used to form a replica of the Bruce's throne.
