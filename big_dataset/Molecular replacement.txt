Molecular replacement (or MR) is a method of solving the phase problem in X-ray crystallography. MR relies upon the existence of a previously solved protein structure which is similar to our unknown structure from which the diffraction data is derived. This could come from a homologous protein, or from the lower-resolution protein NMR structure of the same protein.The first goal of the crystallographer is to obtain an electron density map, density being related with diffracted wave as follows:

        x

        z
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            V
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            h
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            k
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            l
          
        
        
          |
        
        
          F
          
            h
            k
            l

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (x,y,z)={\frac {1}{V}}\sum _{h}\sum _{k}\sum _{l}|F_{hkl}|\exp(2\pi i(hx+ky+lz)+i\Phi (hkl)).}
  
With usual detectors the intensity 
  
    
      
        I
        =
        F
        ⋅

    {\displaystyle I=F\cdot F^{*}}
   is being measured, and all the information about phase (
  
    
      
        Φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi }
  ) is lost. Then, in the absence of phases (Φ), we are unable to complete the shown Fourier transform relating the experimental data from X-ray crystallography (in reciprocal space) to real-space electron density, into which the atomic model is built. MR tries to find the model which fits best experimental intensities among known structures.
