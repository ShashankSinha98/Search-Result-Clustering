A crisper drawer (also known as a crisper) is a compartment within a refrigerator designed to prolong the freshness of stored produce. Crisper drawers have a different level of humidity from the rest of the refrigerator, optimizing freshness in fruits and vegetables. Some can be adjusted to either prevent the loss of moisture from produce, or to allow ethylene gas produced by certain fruits to escape in order to prevent them from rotting quickly.
