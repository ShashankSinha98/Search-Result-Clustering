Spectrum Cloudbase, often shortened to Cloudbase, is the fictional skyborne headquarters of the international security organisation Spectrum from Gerry Anderson's science-fiction television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967â€“68). In the 2005 computer-animated remake, Cloudbase is re-imagined as Skybase.
In both series, the base's design is that of an airborne aircraft carrier, stationed in either Earth's high troposphere (in the original series) or low stratosphere (in the remake).
