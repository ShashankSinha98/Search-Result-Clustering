In Mike We Trust is a young adult gay novel by P. E. Ryan first published in 2009. It depicts a teenage gay boy who falls under the sway of his con artist uncle (who is the twin brother of the boy's recently deceased father). The boy struggles with his sexual orientation as well as the need for honesty when his beloved role model asks him to lie.
The book was a Lambda Literary Award finalist for LGBT Children's/Young Adult literature, and was named by Booklist to its Rainbow List 2010 (bibliography of young adult books which include significant gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or questioning content). This is the second young adult novel focusing on LGBTQ teens by author P. E. Ryan, whose first effort in the genre was 2008's Saints of Augustine.  As Patrick Ryan, he wrote Send Me, a novel for adults.
