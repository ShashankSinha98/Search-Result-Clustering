The SU-122-44 was a Soviet self-propelled gun (SPG) designed in early 1944 with a  122 mm (4.8 in) D-25S gun, with its fighting compartment situated at the front of the hull. The "44" in its name referred to the T-44 tank which the design was based on. The front had a sloped 90 mm (3.5 in) armor plate inclined at 27 degrees. The side armor was 76.2 mm (3.00 in) thick, and the rear was 45 mm (1.8 in) thick. The design was found to be too heavy for the chassis, its competitor, the SU-100-M-2, proved a superior design, and on 7 March 1945 all work on the SU-122-44 was terminated with no prototypes built.
