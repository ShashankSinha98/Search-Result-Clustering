The Aqueduct at Marly is an 1874 painting by Alfred Sisley. It was bought from the artist by Paul Durand-Ruel in 1876 before being acquired by Edward Libbey, who in turn donated it to the Toledo Museum of Art, where it now hangs. It shows the Aqueduc de Louveciennes. A lifesize reproduction of it is sited at the site of its creation as part of the Pays des Impressionnistes scheme.
